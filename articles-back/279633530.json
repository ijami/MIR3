{"id":279633530,"name":"Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: an introductory example","abstraction":"Drawing a sample from a discrete distribution is one of the building components for Monte Carlo methods. Like other sampling algorithms, discrete sampling also suffers from high computational burden in large-scale inference problems. We study the problem of sampling a discrete random variable with a high degree of dependency that is typical in large-scale Bayesian inference and graphical models, and propose an efficient approximate solution with a subsampling approach. We make a novel connection between the discrete sampling and Multi-Armed Bandits problems with a finite reward population and provide three algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations show the robustness and efficiency of the approximate algorithms in both synthetic and real-world large-scale problems.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224175402_Scaling_the_iHMM_Parallelization_versus_Hadoop","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346425_Bayesian_Learning_via_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236235190_Austerity_in_MCMC_Land_Cutting_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Budget","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262350854_Monte_Carlo_MCMC_efficient_inference_by_approximate_sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286498_Slice_sampling_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2360567_Hoeffding_Races_Accelerating_Model_Selection_Search_for_Classification_and_Function_Approximation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259478458_lil%27_UCB_An_Optimal_Exploration_Algorithm_for_Multi-Armed_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357750_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_in_Sampling_without_Replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239551242_Variance_Reduction_Techniques_for_Digital_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2779476_Algorithms_for_Scoring_Coreference_Chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266660385_Reducing_the_sampling_complexity_of_topic_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225209253_Optimum_Follow_the_Leader_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111135_Perturb-and-MAP_random_fields_Using_discrete_optimization_to_learn_and_sample_from_energy_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215470704_Incorporating_Non-local_Information_into_Information_Extraction_Systems_by_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264948136_A_Sequential_Multiple-Decision_Procedure_for_Selecting_the_Best_One_of_Several_Normal_Populations_with_a_Common_Unknown_Variance_and_Its_Use_with_Various_Experimental_Designs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262030260_Ergodicity_of_Approximate_MCMC_Chains_with_Applications_to_Large_Data_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235709950_A_Sequential_Procedure_for_Selecting_the_Population_with_the_Largest_Mean_from_k_Normal_Populations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38350870_Sensitivity_and_convergence_of_uniformly_ergodic_Markov_chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764505_Bayesian_Model_Choice_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320734_Distributed_Algorithms_for_Topic_Models"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[224175402,221346425,236235190,256606492,262350854,221618614,220286498,2360567,259478458,38357750,239551242,2779476,266660385,221996154,225209253,220343796,221111135,215470704,264948136,262030260,235709950,38350870,243764505,220320734],"pageRank":0.0}
