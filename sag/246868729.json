{"id":246868729,"name":"Improving the acceptance in Monte Carlo simulations: Sampling through intermediate states","abstraction":"A general method is presented for computation of radial distribution functions for plasmas over a wide range of temperatures and densities. The method uses the Monte Carlo technique applied by Wood and Parker, and extends this to long-range forces using results borrowed from crystal lattice theory. The approach is then used to calculate the radial distribution functions for a proton-electron plasma of density 1018 electrons/cm3 at a temperature of 104 OK. The results show the usefulness of the method if sufficient computing facilities are available.","authors":["A. A.
