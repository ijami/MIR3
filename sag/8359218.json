{"id":8359218,"name":"A note on using the adjusted Rand index for link prediction in networks","abstraction":"This article provides an investigation of cluster validation indices that relates 4 of the indices to the L. Hubert and P. Arabie (1985) adjusted Rand index--the cluster validation measure of choice (G. W. Milligan \u0026 M. C. Cooper, 1986). It is shown how these other indices can be \"roughly\" transformed into the same scale as the adjusted Rand index. Furthermore, in-depth explanations are given of why classification rates should not be used in cluster validation research. The article concludes by summarizing several properties of the adjusted Rand index across many conditions and provides a method for testing the significance of observed adjusted Rand indices.","authors":["Douglas Steinley"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275060222_A_note_on_using_the_adjusted_Rand_index_for_link_prediction_in_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260411112_Classification_and_comparison_of_natural_and_altered_flow_regimes_to_support_an_Australian_trial_of_the_Ecological_Limits_of_Hydrologic_Alteration_ELOHA_framework","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234005561_Identifying_Research_Fields_within_Business_and_Management_A_JournalCross-Citation_Analysis"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11286015_A_comparison_of_maximum_covariance_and_K-means_cluster_analysis_in_classifying_cases_into_known_taxon_groups","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9026657_Local_Optima_in_K-Means_Clustering_What_You_Don%27t_Know_May_Hurt_You","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24056023_A_computer_program_to_calculate_Hubert_and_Arabie%27s_adjusted_Rand_index","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247742629_Methodology_Review_Clustering_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247503144_Monte_Carlo_Tests_of_the_Accuracy_of_Cluster_Analysis_Algorithms_A_Comparison_of_Hierarchical_and_Nonhierarchical_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247503221_A_Comparison_of_Cluster_Analysis_Techniques_Within_a_Sequential_Validation_Framework","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261679600_Assignment_Methods_in_Combinatorial_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215666104_Clustering_validation_results_and_implications_for_applied_analyses","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240237351_A_Method_for_Generating_Simulated_Plasmodes_and_Artificial_Test_Clusters_with_User-Defined_Shape_Size_and_Orientation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224377708_The_Effect_of_Cluster_Size_Dimensionality_and_the_Number_of_Clusters_on_Recovery_of_True_Cluster_Structure"],"citedInIDs":[275060222,260411112,234005561],"refrenceIDs":[11286015,9026657,24056023,247742629,247503144,247503221,261679600,215666104,240237351,224377708],"pageRank":6.15671781688976E-4}
