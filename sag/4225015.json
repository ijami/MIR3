{"id":4225015,"name":"Weakly Supervised Part-of-Speech Tagging for Morphologically-Rich, Resource-Scarce Languages.","abstraction":"We demonstrate that a simple hidden Markov model can achieve state of the art performance in unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, by improving aspects of standard Baum-Welch (EM) estimation. One improvement uses word similarities to smooth the lexical tag → word probability estimates, which avoids over-fitting the lexical model. Another improvement constrains the model to preserve a specified marginal distribution over the hidden tags, which avoids over-fitting the tag → tag transition model. Although using more contextual information than an HMM remains desirable, improving basic estimation still leads to significant improvements and remains a prerequisite for training more complex models.","authors":["Q.I.
