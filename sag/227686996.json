{"id":227686996,"name":"Image segmentation by polygonal Markov Fields","abstraction":"A method introduced by Arjas \u0026 Gasbarra (1994) and later modified by Arjas \u0026 Heikkinen (1997) for the non-parametric Bayesian estimation of an intensity on the real line is generalized to cover spatial processes. The method is based on a model approximation where the approximating intensities have the structure of a piecewise constant function. Random step functions on the plane are generated using Voronoi tessellations of random point patterns. Smoothing between nearby intensity values is applied by means of a Markov random field prior in the spirit of Bayesian image analysis. The performance of the method is illustrated in examples with both real and simulated data.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24052917_Image_segmentation_by_polygonal_Markov_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223457711_Bayesian_inference_for_spatially_inhomogeneous_pairwise_interacting_point_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653841_Finding_simple_intensity_descriptions_from_event_sequence_data"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2606787_On_Conditional_and_Intrinsic_Autoregression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24051882_Likelihood_analysis_of_spatial_inhomogeneity_for_marked_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232841830_Digital_Image_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363225_Practical_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Stat_Sci_7_473-483","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265620657_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227701452_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes"],"citedInIDs":[24052917,223457711,221653841],"refrenceIDs":[2606787,2670104,24051882,232841830,38363225,265620657,227701452],"pageRank":6.011053088108499E-4}
