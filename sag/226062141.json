{"id":226062141,"name":"Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes","abstraction":"This paper looks at a new approach to the problem of finding the maximal tolerated dose (or optimal dose, Eichhorn and Zacks, 1973) of certain drugs which in addition to their therapeutic effects have secondary harmful effects. The problem is investigated in a sequential setting from a Bayesian predictive approach. Search procedures are proposed for parametric and nonparametric models.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221997021_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238853275_A_Bayesian_nonparametric_approach_to_determining_a_maximum_tolerated_dose","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5207138_Semiparametric_regression_for_count_data"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31002191_Sequential_Choice_of_an_Optimal_Dose_A_Prediction_Intervals_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243048682_Bayes_sequential_search_of_optimal_dosage_Linear_regression_with_parameters_unknown","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362692_Contributions_to_the_Theory_of_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357647_Discreteness_of_Ferguson_Selections","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35336839_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_processes_with_applications_to_Bayesian_nonparametric_problems_microform","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359970_On_the_Consistency_of_Bayes_Estimates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268712750_The_Relevance_of_Stopping_Rules_in_Statistical_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233282787_Sequential_Search_of_an_Optimal_Dosage_for_Cases_of_Linear_Dosage_-_Toxicity_Regression"],"citedInIDs":[221997021,238853275,5207138],"refrenceIDs":[31002191,243048682,38362692,38357647,38357862,35336839,38359970,38357634,268712750,233282787],"pageRank":0.0013937371424082626}
