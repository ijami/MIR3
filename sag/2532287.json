{"id":2532287,"name":"A History of Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming","abstraction":"Recently, new representation languages that integrate first order logic with Bayesian networks have been developed. Bayesian logic programs are one of these languages. In this paper, we present results on combining Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) with Bayesian networks to learn both the qualitative and the quantitative components of Bayesian logic programs. More precisely, we show how to combine the ILP setting learning from interpretations with score-based techniques for learning Bayesian networks. Thus, the paper positively answers Koller and Pfeffer\u0027s question, whether techniques from ILP could help to learn the logical component of first order probabilistic models.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273515460_A_History_of_Probabilistic_Inductive_Logic_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224039783_Lower_Complexity_Bounds_for_Lifted_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236256088_Liftability_of_probabilistic_inference_Upper_and_lower_bounds"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221475022_Bayesian_Logic_Programs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220815459_A_Theory_of_Clausal_Discovery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995760_Probabilistic_Networks_and_Expert_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226048844_Clausal_Discovery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242423211_Foundations_of_Logic_Progamming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225395207_Learning_Probabilistic_Relational_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2358055_ATutorial_on_Learning_With_Bayesian_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2579709_Learning_Probabilities_for_Noisy_First-Order_Rules","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225149862_A_Tutorial_on_Learning_With_Bayesian_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2439473_Learning_Probabilistic_Relational_Models_with_Structural_Uncertainty"],"citedInIDs":[273515460,224039783,236256088],"refrenceIDs":[221475022,220815459,221995760,226048844,242423211,225395207,2358055,2579709,225149862,2439473],"pageRank":8.379643178793582E-4}
