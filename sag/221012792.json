{"id":221012792,"name":"A New Entity Salience Task with Millions of Training Examples","abstraction":"Coreference systems are driven by syntactic, se- mantic, and discourse constraints. We present a simple approach which completely modularizes these three aspects. In contrast to much current work, which focuses on learning and on the dis- course component, our system is deterministic and is driven entirely by syntactic and semantic com- patibility as learned from a large, unlabeled corpus. Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our system substantially outperforms all unsupervised systems and most supervised ones. Primary con- tributions include (1) the presentation of a simple- to-reproduce, high-performing baseline and (2) the demonstration that most remaining errors can be at- tributed to syntactic and semantic factors external to the coreference phenomenon (and perhaps best addressed by non-coreference systems).","authors":["Dan Klein"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274897172_A_New_Entity_Salience_Task_with_Millions_of_Training_Examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270877464_Interpreting_Consumer_Health_Questions_The_Role_of_Anaphora_and_Ellipsis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262166615_Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50520407_Exploiting_role-identifying_nouns_and_expressions_for_information_extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215470704_Incorporating_Non-local_Information_into_Information_Extraction_Systems_by_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013163_EMNLP%2708_Understanding_the_Value_of_Features_for_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013214_Unsupervised_Models_for_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873401_Enforcing_Transitivity_in_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873885_Improving_Machine_Learning_Approaches_to_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875038_A_Mention-Synchronous_Coreference_Resolution_Algorithm_Based_On_the_Bell_Tree","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817243_Joint_Determination_of_Anaphoricity_and_Coreference_Resolution_using_Integer_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817650_On_Coreference_Resolution_Performance_Metrics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012925_Joint_Unsupervised_Coreference_Resolution_with_Markov_Logic"],"citedInIDs":[274897172,270877464,262166615],"refrenceIDs":[50520407,215470704,221013163,221013214,220873401,220873885,220875038,220817243,220817650,221012925],"pageRank":9.439446894093875E-4}
