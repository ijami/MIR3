{"id":221618614,"name":"Grammars for Games: A Gradient-Based, Game-Theoretic Framework for Optimization in Deep Learning","abstraction":"This contribution develops a theoretical framework that takes into account the effect of approximate optimization on learning algorithms. The analysis shows distinct tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-sc ale learning problems. Small-scale learning problems are subject to the usual approximation-estimation tradeoff. Large-scale learning problems are subject to a qualitatively different tradeoff involving the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithms in non-trivial ways.","authors":["LÃ©on Bottou"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291186593_Grammars_for_Games_A_Gradient-Based_Game-Theoretic_Framework_for_Optimization_in_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282863279_SGD_Algorithms_based_on_Incomplete_U-statistics_Large-Scale_Minimization_of_Empirical_Risk","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280873163_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Analysis_of_a_Parallel_Boosting_Algorithm"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781432_Theory_of_Classification_A_Survey_of_Some_Recent_Advances","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222625567_On_the_complexity_of_loading_shallow_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2560520_Statistical_Behavior_and_Consistency_of_Classification_Methods_based_on_Convex_Risk_Minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500215_Measuring_the_VC-Dimension_of_a_Learning_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349018_Optimal_aggregation_of_classifiers_in_statistical_learning_Annals_of_Statististics_321","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742228_Convexity_Classification_and_Risk_Bounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3087002_Correction_to_The_Importance_of_Convexity_in_Learning_With_Squared_Loss_Sep_98_1974-1980","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2852039_A_Few_Notes_on_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320717_QP_Algorithms_with_Guaranteed_Accuracy_and_Run_Time_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41712113_Theory_of_Classification_A_Survey_of_Some_Recent_Advances"],"citedInIDs":[291186593,282863279,280873163],"refrenceIDs":[41781432,222625567,2560520,220500215,38349018,4742228,3087002,2852039,220320717,41712113],"pageRank":8.914113659535946E-4}
