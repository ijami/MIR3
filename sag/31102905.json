{"id":31102905,"name":"Nonparametric binary regression using a Gaussian process prior","abstraction":"Previous attempts at implementing fully Bayesian nonparametric bioassay have enjoyed limited success due to computational difficulties. We show here how this problem may be generally handled using a sampling based approach to develop desired marginal posterior distributions and their features. A useful extension is presented which treats the case of ordered polytomous response. Illustrative examples are provided.","authors":["ALAN E.
