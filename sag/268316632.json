{"id":268316632,"name":"The Bayesian Analysis of Population Pharmacokinetic Models","abstraction":"Population data fit very naturally into a hierarchical framework. At the first stage of this hierarchy the data of a particular individual are modelled, typically by a nonlinear regression model, with the same regression model assumed for each individual. Inter-individual variability is accommodated at the second stage by assuming that the parameters of each individual are independently and identically distributed from a population distribution F. Often, interest is in learning about F so that predictions can be made for future individuals from the population. Previous Bayesian work has largely concentrated on F being assigned a specific parametric form, typically the normal. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach using the Dirichlet process as a class of prior distributions for F. We consider the important case where covariate relationships are modelled at the second stage, and allow for errors-in-variables in the measured covariates. Relevant posterior distributions are summarised using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. A challenging population pharmacokinetic dataset, involving a nonlinear concentration/time relationship and individual-specific covariates, is analysed and the results are compared with those of previous non-Bayesian parametric and nonparametric analyses.","authors":["Stephen Walker","Jon Wakefield"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247789811_The_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Population_Pharmacokinetic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13821106_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Population_Models_Formulation_and_Comparison_with_Likelihood_Approaches","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247562481_A_Bayesian_Population_Model_With_Hierarchical_Mixture_Priors_Applied_to_Blood_Count_Data"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[247789811,13821106,247562481],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":5.955303842742907E-4}
