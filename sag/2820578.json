A web tour guide agent provides assistance similar to that provided by a human tour guide in a museum -- it guides the user along an appropriate path through the collection, based on its knowledge of the user\u0027s interests, of the location and relevance of various items in the collection, and of the way in which others have interacted with the collection in the past.

But visitors find it difficult to locate rele...","authors":["Thorsten Joachims","Dayne Freitag","Tom Mitchell"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280548817_Agent_Oriented_Framework_for_Making_Websites_Adaptive","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273513985_Profile-Based_Summarisation_for_Web_Site_Navigation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283495292_The_use_of_Frameworks_in_the_making_of_web_documents"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2612701_Stable_Function_Approximation_in_Dynamic_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2594035_WebWatcher_Machine_Learning_and_Hypertext","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2555259_WebWatcher_A_Learning_Apprentice_for_the_World_Wide_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6065902_Developments_in_Automatic_Text_Retrieval","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2436904_Learning_Information_Retrieval_Agents_Experiments_with_Automated_Web_Browsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2427179_Letizia_An_Agent_That_Assists_Web_Browsing"],"citedInIDs":[280548817,273513985,283495292],"refrenceIDs":[2612701,2594035,2555259,6065902,2436904,2427179],"pageRank":6.929961134071248E-4}
