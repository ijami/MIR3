{"id":280062253,"name":"Beyond Weber\u0027s Law: A Second Look at Ranking Visualizations of Correlation","abstraction":"Mobility predictors proposed so far exploit the patterns from the past mobility trajectory collected by an individual user. Thus, if the training data collected by each user (i.e., the past trajectory) is not sufficient due to short training period or energy constraint, those predictors suffer from the low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we develop cluster-aided mobility predictors which use the data collected by all users to predict the next location of a given user. More specifically, based on a non-parametric bayesian statistics in which a clustering technique is involved, the proposed predictor exploits the data of other users whose mobility patterns are similar (i.e., associated to a same cluster). We analytically prove the consistency of the proposed predictor, and evaluate its performance using real mobility datasets.","authors":["Jaeseong Jeong","Mathieu Leconte","Alexandre Proutiere"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220926441_BreadCrumbs_Forecasting_mobile_connectivity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237197966_Enhancing_Mobile_Data_Offloading_with_Mobility_Prediction_and_Prefetching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260521046_SmartDC_Mobility_Prediction-Based_Adaptive_Duty_Cycling_for_Everyday_Location_Monitoring","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3436589_Evaluating_Next-Cell_Predictors_with_Extensive_Wi-Fi_Mobility_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221015935_NextPlace_A_Spatio-Temporal_Prediction_Framework_for_Pervasive_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241630572_Evaluating_mobility_models_for_temporal_prediction_with_high-granularity_mobility_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3522021_Universal_prediction_of_individual_sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080689_An_Universal_Predictor_Based_on_Pattern_Matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286632_Nonparametric_empirical_Bayes_for_the_Dirichlet_process_mixture_model"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[220926441,237197966,260521046,3436589,221015935,241630572,3522021,3080689,38357634,220286632],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
