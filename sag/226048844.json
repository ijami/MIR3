{"id":226048844,"name":"Inductive logic programming in databases: From Datalog to DL+LOG","abstraction":"The clausal discovery engine claudien is presented. CLAUDIEN is an inductive logic programming engine that fits in the descriptive data mining paradigm. CLAUDIEN addresses characteristic induction from interpretations, a task which is related to existing formalisations of induction in logic. In characteristic induction from interpretations, the regularities are represented by clausal theories, and the data using Herbrand interpretations. Because CLAUDIEN uses clausal logic to represent hypotheses, the regularities induced typically involve multiple relations or predicates. CLAUDIEN also employs a novel declarative bias mechanism to define the set of clauses that may appear in a hypothesis.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238720679_Inductive_logic_programming_in_databases_From_Datalog_to_DLLOG","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24013710_Learning_Rules_from_Multisource_Data_for_Cardiac_Monitoring","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45905973_Inductive_Logic_Programming_in_Databases_from_Datalog_to_DLlog"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2459925_Multiple_Predicate_Learning_with_RTL","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220547300_First-Order_jk-Clausal_Theories_are_PAC-Learnable","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220815459_A_Theory_of_Clausal_Discovery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222362755_Grammatically_biased_learning_learning_logic_programs_using_an_explicit_antecedent_description_languageArtificial_Intelligence_68303-366","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2757164_The_ILP_description_learning_problem_Towards_a_general_model-level_definition_of_data_mining_in_ILP","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816303_Avoiding_Pitfalls_When_Learning_Recursive_Theories","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816264_Multiple_Predicate_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2425607_Inverse_entailment_and_Progol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222442069_Generalization_As_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221393261_Induction_as_Nonmonotonic_Inference"],"citedInIDs":[238720679,24013710,45905973],"refrenceIDs":[2459925,220547300,220815459,222362755,2757164,220816303,220816264,2425607,222442069,221393261],"pageRank":0.001399152786354143}
