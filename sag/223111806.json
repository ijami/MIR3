Let (k/n, V) denote the cardinality of the largest W ⊆ V such that any two distinct vectors in W differ on at least k indices. We show that (k/n, V) ≤ (cn/(k + d))d for some constant c. This improves on the previous best result of . This new result has applications in the theory of empirical processes.","authors":["David Haussler"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274403450_Fully_explicit_large_deviation_inequalities_for_empirical_processes_with_applications_to_information-based_complexity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274094880_Sign_rank_versus_VC_dimension","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272751998_Teaching_and_compressing_for_low_VC-dimension"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222190436_Decision_Theoretic_Generalizations_of_the_PAC_Model_for_Neural_Net_and_Other_Learning_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220430853_Learnability_and_the_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_dimension_J_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239050940_The_shifting_technique_in_extremal_set_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361216_Universal_Donsker_Classes_and_Metric_Entropy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361217_Donsker_Classes_and_Random_Geometry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361515_Some_Limit_Theorems_for_Empirical_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242471522_Technical_report_ucsc-crl-90-54","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362112_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Empirical_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234815089_Partitioning_and_geometric_embedding_of_range_spaces_of_finite_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_dimension","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220079198_On_the_Density_of_Families_of_Sets"],"citedInIDs":[274403450,274094880,272751998],"refrenceIDs":[222190436,220430853,239050940,38361216,38361217,38361515,242471522,38362112,234815089,220079198],"pageRank":6.91770295329027E-4}
