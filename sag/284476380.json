{"id":284476380,"name":"A combinatorial approach to small ball inequalities for sums and differences","abstraction":"We develop a scalable deep non-parametric generative model by augmenting deep Gaussian processes with a recognition model. Inference is performed in a novel scalable variational framework where the variational posterior distributions are reparametrized through a multilayer perceptron. The key aspect of this reformulation is that it prevents the proliferation of variational parameters which otherwise grow linearly in proportion to the sample size. We derive a new formulation of the variational lower bound that allows us to distribute most of the computation in a way that enables to handle datasets of the size of mainstream deep learning tasks. We show the efficacy of the method on a variety of challenges including deep unsupervised learning and deep Bayesian optimization.","authors":["Zhenwen Dai","Neil Lawrence"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283761858_Training_Deep_Gaussian_Processes_using_Stochastic_Expectation_Propagation_and_Probabilistic_Backpropagation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283296556_Deep_Gaussian_Processes_and_Variational_Propagation_of_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278775039_Additive_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Process_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320835_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225237917_Efficient_Global_Optimization_of_Expensive_Black-Box_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267375494_Bayesian_Gaussian_Processes_for_Sequential_Prediction_Optimisation_and_Quadrature","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781188_Warped_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257410088_A_Deep_and_Tractable_Density_Estimator"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[283761858,283296556,278775039,220320835,225237917,2985446,267375494,41781188,225307589,257410088],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
