{"id":266911194,"name":"Costing Generated Runtime Execution Plans for Large-Scale Machine Learning Programs","abstraction":"SystemML enables declarative, large-scale machine learning (ML) via a high-level language with R-like syntax. Data scientists use this language to express their ML algorithms with full flexibility but without the need to hand-tune distributed runtime execution plans and system configurations. These ML pro- grams are dynamically compiled and optimized based on data and cluster characteristics using rule- and cost-based optimization techniques. The compiler automatically generates hybrid runtime execu- tion plans ranging from in-memory, single node execution to distributed MapReduce (MR) computation and data access. This paper describes the SystemML optimizer, its compilation chain, and selected optimization phases for generating efficient execution plans.","authors":["Matthias Boehm","Douglas R.
