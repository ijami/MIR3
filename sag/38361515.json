{"id":38361515,"name":"Kernel-type estimators of divergence measures and its strong uniformconsistency","abstraction":"In this paper we provide a general framework for the study of the central limit theorem (CLT) for empirical processes indexed by uniformly bounded families of functions $\\mathscr{F}$. From this we obtain essentially all known results for the CLT in this case; we improve Dudley\u0027s (1982) theorem on entropy with bracketing and Kolcinskii\u0027s (1981) CLT under random entropy conditions. One of our main results is that a combinatorial condition together with the existence of the limiting Gaussian process are necessary and sufficient for the CLT for a class of sets (modulo a measurability condition). The case of unbounded $\\mathscr{F}$ is also considered; a general CLT as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for the law of large numbers are obtained in this case. The results for empiricals also yield some new CLT\u0027s in $C\\lbrack 0, 1\\rbrack$ and $D\\lbrack 0, 1\\rbrack$.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282569738_Kernel-type_estimators_of_divergence_measures_and_its_strong_uniformconsistency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280773229_A_subsampled_double_bootstrap_for_massive_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272845471_On_aggregation_for_heavy-tailed_classes"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361518_Probability_Inequalities_for_Empirical_Processes_and_a_Law_of_the_Iterated_Logarithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243006361_Inequalities_for_monotonic_series","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225896104_Central_limit_theorems_in_D0_1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243022323_Central_limit_theorems_for_CS-valued_random_variables1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361629_Some_Results_on_LIL_Behavior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24059865_The_minimum_distance_method_of_testing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226013354_General_chi-square_goodness-of-fit_tests_with_data-dependent_cells","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220079198_On_the_Density_of_Families_of_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362739_Sample_Functions_of_the_Gaussian_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362112_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Empirical_Measures"],"citedInIDs":[282569738,280773229,272845471],"refrenceIDs":[38361518,243006361,225896104,243022323,38361629,24059865,226013354,220079198,38362739,38362112],"pageRank":0.0039286122411754726}
