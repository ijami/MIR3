{"id":262991675,"name":"Black box variational inference for state space models","abstraction":"We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning. Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.","authors":["Shakir Mohamed","Daan Wierstra"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284579582_Black_box_variational_inference_for_state_space_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476621_Iterative_Refinement_of_Approximate_Posterior_for_Training_Directed_Belief_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284219020_Generating_Sentences_from_a_Continuous_Space"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259578079_On_Using_Control_Variates_with_Stochastic_Approximation_for_Variational_Bayes_and_its_Connection_to_Stochastic_Linear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279964320_Simple_statistical_gradient-following_algorithms_for_connectionist_reinforcement_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239551242_Variance_Reduction_Techniques_for_Digital_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23252767_The_Variational_Gaussian_Approximation_Revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267706055_Practical_Variational_Inference_for_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095632_Variational_Bayesian_Inference_with_Stochastic_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1961033_Mean_Field_Theory_for_Sigmoid_Belief_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338024_Variational_Learning_in_Nonlinear_Gaussian_Belief_Networks"],"citedInIDs":[284579582,284476621,284219020],"refrenceIDs":[259578079,279964320,239551242,23252767,267706055,228095632,1961033,13338024],"pageRank":0.0016018758117316498}
