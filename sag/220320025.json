{"id":220320025,"name":"Data Selection Based on Decision Tree for SVM Classification on Large Data Sets","abstraction":"Working set selection is an important step in decomposition methods for training support vector machines (SVMs). This paper develops a new technique for working set selection in SMO-type decomposition methods. It uses second order information to achieve fast con- vergence. Theoretical properties such as linear convergence are established. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is faster than existing selection methods using first order information.","authors":["Rong-En Fan","Pai-Hsuen Chen"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282433142_Data_Selection_Based_on_Decision_Tree_for_SVM_Classification_on_Large_Data_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283180992_Nearest_neighbors_methods_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276077803_Support_Vector_Machines_Networks_to_Hybrid_Neuro-Genetic_SVMs_in_Portfolio_Selection"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228680301_Linear_convergence_of_a_decomposition_method_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224141515_Building_projectable_classifiers_of_arbitrary_complexity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2462099_Polynomial-Time_Decomposition_Algorithms_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2464475_Training_Support_Vector_Machines_an_Application_to_Face_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2376111_A_Training_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Margin_Classifier","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234786663_Fast_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines_Using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2446719_Improvements_to_Platt%27s_SMO_Algorithm_for_SVM_Classifier_Design","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3303017_On_the_convergence_of_the_decomposition_method_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12413257_New_Support_Vector_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343922_Support_Vector_Network"],"citedInIDs":[282433142,283180992,276077803],"refrenceIDs":[228680301,224141515,2462099,2464475,2376111,234786663,2446719,3303017,12413257,220343922],"pageRank":8.207056800201942E-4}
