{"id":2356836,"name":"Enhancing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio of ICA-Based Extracted ERPs","abstraction":"In this paper we introduce a novel approach to the problem of decomposition of auditory evoked fields (AEF), measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG), into basic components. This approach is based on independent component analysis (ICA), that separates components according to the kurtosis of their amplitude distribution over time. The fixed-point algorithm used extracts one independent component at a time, allowing the combination of a high resolution 122-channel whole-scalp neuromagnetometer, to a fast and very efficient implementation of ICA. We show that the independent components found on averaged auditory evoked fields isolate the main response (around 100ms) from subsequent components (around 200ms), and can discriminate between the contra- and the ipsilateral responses from the brain, in a clear dipolar manner, agreeing with the classical source modeling in AEF\u0027s. 1 Introduction Auditory evoked field studies (AEF) have been an important source of information on the...","authors":["Ricardo Vigrio","Jaakko Srel"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7176499_Enhancing_the_Signal-to-Noise_Ratio_of_ICA-Based_Extracted_ERPs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27608802_Panorama_des_applications_biomedicales_des_methodes_de_separation_aveugle_de_sources","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12466358_Independent_component_approach_to_the_analysis_of_EEG_and_MEG_recordings_IEEE_Trans_Biomed_Eng"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[7176499,27608802,12466358],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":6.168111320365835E-4}
