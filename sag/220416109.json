{"id":220416109,"name":"Linking named entities to any database","abstraction":"Kylin, a system, which is self-supervised learning to train relationally-targeted open information extractors from Wikipedia infoboxes, is studied. Open Information Extractions (IE) is different from traditional methods in input, target schema where IE opens automatically and discovers the relations of interest and computational complexity. Target relation within an infobox, Kylin queries to identify and verify relevant sentences that mention the attribute\u0027s value. Improvement in Kylin\u0027s integration abilities through the use of probabilistic CFG\u0027s is also expected, which may provide a cleaner way to integrate page and sentence classification with extraction and also enables joint inference. Shrinkage and retaining allows Kylin to improve extractor robustness, and these extractors can successfully mine tuples from a broader set of web pages. Kylin primarily uses the relational approach and the best option for jointly optimizing extraction generality, precision, and recall will be to further combine relational and structural approaches.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262241572_Linking_named_entities_to_any_database","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252967947_Felix_Scaling_Inference_for_Markov_Logic_with_an_Operator-based_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221035510_Find_your_Advisor_Robust_Knowledge_Gathering_from_the_Web"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49940356_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221022804_YAGO_a_core_of_semantic_knowledge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221023402_Automatically_refining_the_wikipedia_infobox_ontology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220814723_Open_Information_Extraction_from_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221515340_Faceted_metadata_for_image_search_and_browsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221517779_Amplifying_community_content_creation_with_mixed-initiative_information_extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221654198_A_unified_approach_for_schema_matching_coreference_and_canonicalization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221614577_Autonomously_semantifying_wikipedia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221604622_Joint_Inference_in_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875066_Semantic_Taxonomy_Induction_from_Heterogenous_Evidence"],"citedInIDs":[262241572,252967947,221035510],"refrenceIDs":[49940356,221022804,221023402,220814723,221515340,221517779,221654198,221614577,221604622,220875066],"pageRank":5.783394597448971E-4}
