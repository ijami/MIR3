{"id":221345588,"name":"Describing and Understanding Neighborhood Characteristics through Online Social Media","abstraction":"When documents are organized in a large number of topic categories, the categories are often arranged in a hierarchy. The US patent database and Yahoo are two examples. The paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classifier can be significantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smooths parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies. Experimental results on three real world data sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate Web pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29\\% over the traditional flat classifier.","authors":["Ronald Rosenfeld","Tom M.
