{"id":228434680,"name":"Change point detection based on call detail records","abstraction":"For a Poisson process with a change-point, a uniform prior is commonly used for the change-point, but it is more realistic to put a unimodal prior on it, which outlines an important feature of prior beliefs. We consider a couple of unimodal priors on the change-point first and use ML-II approach to obtain the empirical Bayes estimators in this paper. The Bayes factor is used for the selection of a suitable prior. The procedure is applied to the British coal-mining disaster data. Finally, a comparison among these empirical Bayes estimators is made by Monte Carlo integration. It turns out that the ML-II Beta prior fit the data most, which corresponds to the prior belief of unimodality.","authors":["Yi-Hsiung Lin","Mei-Mei Zen"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224545149_Change_point_detection_based_on_call_detail_records","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225508998_Detecting_population_decline_of_birds_using_long-term_monitoring_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226390187_Objective_Bayesian_analysis_of_the_changepoint_problem"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31101623_The_Time_Intervals_Between_Industrial_Accidents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239062083_Statistical_Methods_For_The_Reliability_Of_Repairable_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246334914_Good_Thinking_The_Foundations_of_Probability_and_Its_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243082455_A_Note_on_the_Intervals_Between_Coal-Mining_Disasters"],"citedInIDs":[224545149,225508998,226390187],"refrenceIDs":[31101623,239062083,246334914,243082455],"pageRank":9.225956224315879E-4}
