{"id":232354851,"name":"Modeling heteroscedasticity in the single-index model with the dirichlet process","abstraction":"The use of a Dirichlet process prior for nonparametric Bayes procedures was first proposed by Ferguson (Ann. Statist.1 (1973) 209â€“230). Computational problems which have limited its usefulness in hierarchical models can be overcome by sampling from a reiterated Markov chain. A method is demonstrated which improves parametric Bayesian estimators or parametric empirical Bayesian estimators by embedding the parametric analysis in a nonparametric Bayesian analysis. A Monte Carlo study showing the effectiveness of this approach when estimating a vector of normal means is presented.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251342516_Modeling_heteroscedasticity_in_the_single-index_model_with_the_dirichlet_process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266405118_C01lPUTING_NORJtIALIZING_CONSTANTS_FOR_FINITE_MIXTURE_MODELS_VIA_INCRElVlENTAL_MIXTURE_IMPORTANCE_SAlVIPLING_IMIS","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265356339_CASE_AND_COVARIATE_INFLUENCE_IMPLICATIONS_FOR_MODEL_ASSESSMENT"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243774153_Algorithm_AS_183_An_Efficient_and_Portable_Pseudo-Random_Number_Generator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239037406_Nonparametric_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_a_Mixing_Distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221669734_Equations_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060446_Estimating_the_means_of_several_normal_populations_by_estimating_the_distribution_of_the_means_PhD_thesis_Yale_University","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910629_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_Calculate_Marginal_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238684341_Estimating_Normal_Means_with_a_Dirichlet_Process_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239061805_Data_Analysis_Using_Stein%27s_Estimator_and_Its_Generalizations"],"citedInIDs":[251342516,266405118,265356339],"refrenceIDs":[243774153,220182914,239037406,38357634,221669734,2741222,239060446,224910629,238684341,239061805],"pageRank":0.0013657920458946006}
