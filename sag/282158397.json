{"id":282158397,"name":"Travellers\u0027 Use of Information Obtained at Tourist Information Centres: Comparison between Information Seekers and Convenience Stoppers","abstraction":"Measuring the distance between partitions is useful for clustering comparison in different fields. For example, in bioinformatics the measuring mostly obtains through a maximum matching distance MMD, although this is algorithmically demanding and hardly fits certain instances. In fact, another distance measure is being tested, namely one based on information theory and termed variation of information VI. Alternatively, this paper proposes the Hamming distance HD, displaying large range and great measurement sensitivity, while also relying on a neat Boolean representation of partitions. Novel distance HD is computationally handy and shares with VI important characterizing axioms. Developing from the combinatorial concern to translate the traditional Hamming distance from subset to partition lattices, HD constitutes a valuable computational tool for clustering and information processing where a distance between partitions is to be measured.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268620286_Combinatorial_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233038304_A_commentary_on_some_recent_methods_in_sibling_group_reconstruction_based_on_set_coverings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51612309_Almudevar_A_Anderson_EC_A_new_version_of_PRT_software_for_sibling_groups_reconstruction_with_comments_regarding_several_issues_in_the_sibling_reconstruction_problem_Mol_Ecol_Res_12_164-178","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270238217_Estimation_of_Single-Generation_Sibling_Relationships_Based_on_DNA_Markers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51119653_KINALYZER_a_computer_program_for_reconstructing_sibling_groups","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6192978_Reconstructing_sibling_relationships_in_wild_populations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266436172_Combinatorics_Set_Systems_Hypergraphs_Families_of_Vectors_and_Combinatorial_Probability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221313586_Discovering_Kinship_through_Small_Subsets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261854517_SibJoin_A_Fast_Heuristic_for_Half-Sibling_Reconstruction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222354001_The_complexity_of_computing_metric_distances_between_partitions"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[268620286,233038304,51612309,270238217,51119653,6192978,266436172,221313586,261854517,222354001],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
