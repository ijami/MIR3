{"id":277959103,"name":"A dynamic probabilistic material flow modeling method","abstraction":"We show that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with arbitrary depth and nonlinearities, with dropout applied after every weight layer, is mathematically equivalent to an approximation to a well known Bayesian model. This interpretation offers an explanation to some of dropout\u0027s key properties, such as its robustness to over-fitting. Our interpretation allows us to reason about uncertainty in deep learning, and allows the introduction of the Bayesian machinery into existing deep learning frameworks in a principled way.
