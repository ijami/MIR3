{"id":233871642,"name":"Entity identification on microblogs by CRF model with adaptive dependency","abstraction":"Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are undirected graphical models, a special case of which correspond to conditionally-trained finite state machines. A key advantage of these models is their great flexibility to include a wide array of overlapping, multi-granularity, non-independent features of the input. In face of this freedom, an important question that remains is, what features should be used? This paper presents a feature induction method for CRFs. Founded on the principle of constructing only those feature conjunctions that significantly increase log-likelihood, the approach is based on that of Della Pietra et al [1997], but altered to work with conditional rather than joint probabilities, and with additional modifications for providing tractability specifically for a sequence model. In comparison with traditional approaches, automated feature induction offers both improved accuracy and more than an order of magnitude reduction in feature count; it enables the use of richer, higher-order Markov models, and offers more freedom to liberally guess about which atomic features may be relevant to a task. The induction method applies to linear-chain CRFs, as well as to more arbitrary CRF structures, also known as Relational Markov Networks [Taskar \u0026 Koller, 2002]. We present experimental results on a named entity extraction task.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287993389_Entity_identification_on_microblogs_by_CRF_model_with_adaptive_dependency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262608738_Incorporating_conditional_random_fields_and_active_learning_to_improve_sentiment_identification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232276024_Closed-Form_Learning_of_Markov_Networks_from_Dependency_Networks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270192_Discriminative_Learning_for_Label_Sequences_via_Boosting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320545_Text_Chunking_based_on_a_Generalization_of_Winnow","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233971696_Markov_fields_on_finite_graphs_and_lattices_Available_at","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51991698_A_Comparison_of_Algorithms_for_Maximum_Entropy_Parameter_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2271805_Representations_Of_Quasi-Newton_Matrices_And_Their_Use_In_Limited_Memory_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2454029_The_Use_of_Classifiers_in_Sequential_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358552_Markov_Fields_and_Log-Linear_Interaction_Models_for_Contingency_Tables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192689_Inducing_Features_of_Random_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2783658_Combining_Classifiers_in_Text_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2324921_Maximum_Entropy_Markov_Models_for_Information_Extraction_and_Segmentation"],"citedInIDs":[287993389,262608738,232276024],"refrenceIDs":[220270192,220320545,233971696,51991698,2271805,2454029,38358552,3192689,2783658,2324921],"pageRank":0.0010798831776543721}
