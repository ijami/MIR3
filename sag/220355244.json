{"id":220355244,"name":"Inside Out: Two Jointly Predictive Models for Word Representations and Phrase Representations","abstraction":"We address the problem of predicting a word from previous words in a sample of text.In particular, we discuss n-gram models based on classes of words. We also discuss severalstatistical algorithms for assigning words to classes based on the frequency of their cooccurrencewith other words. We find that we are able to extract classes that have the flavor of eithersyntactically based groupings or semantically based groupings, depending on the nature of theunderlying statistics.1...","authors":["Peter F.
