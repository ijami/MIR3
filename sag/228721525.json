{"id":228721525,"name":"Information Extraction","abstraction":"We study representations and relational learning over structured domains within a propositionaliza-tion framework that decouples feature construction and model construction. We describe two complementary approaches that address three aspects of the problem: First, we develop and study a flexible knowledge represen-tation for structured data, with an associated lan-guage that provides the syntax and a well defined equivalent semantics for expressing complex struc-tured data succinctly. Second, we use this lan-guage to automate the process of feature construc-tion by expressing \u0027types\u0027 of objects in the lan-guage, which are instantiated in the ground data, al-lowing us to determine the level at which learning is done. Finally, this process of re-representation of the domain allows general purpose learning schemes, such as feature efficient linear algorithms and probabilistic representations, to be defined over the resulting space, yielding efficient and expres-sive learning of relational functions over a struc-tured domain using propositional means.","authors":["Chad Cumby"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234831842_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233530328_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226445465_Learning_Based_Programming"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2620679_Relational_Representations_that_Facilitate_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227201563_Learning_Quickly_When_Irrelevant_Attributes_Abound_A_New_Linear-threshold_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225723872_Learning_nonrecursive_definitions_of_relations_with_linus","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2454029_The_Use_of_Classifiers_in_Sequential_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226894880_A_Winnow-Based_Approach_to_Context-Sensitive_Spelling_Correction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221475022_Bayesian_Logic_Programs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345268_Feature_Construction_with_Version_Spaces_for_Biochemical_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345858_On_Kernel_Methods_for_Relational_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2867188_Learning_with_Feature_Description_Logics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2389374_Relational_Learning_via_Propositional_Algorithms_An_Information_Extraction_Case_Study"],"citedInIDs":[234831842,233530328,226445465],"refrenceIDs":[2620679,227201563,225723872,2454029,226894880,221475022,221345268,221345858,2867188,2389374],"pageRank":7.675483264755692E-4}
