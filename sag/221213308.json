{"id":221213308,"name":"Ontology Instance Linking: Towards Interlinked Knowledge Graphs","abstraction":"Freebase is a practical, scalable tuple database used to struc- ture general human knowledge. The data in Freebase is collaboratively created, structured, and maintained. Free- base currently contains more than 125,000,000 tuples, more than 4000 types, and more than 7000 properties. Public read/write access to Freebase is allowed through an HTTP- based graph-query API using the Metaweb Query Language (MQL) as a data query and manipulation language. MQL provides an easy-to-use object-oriented interface to the tuple data in Freebase and is designed to facilitate the creation of collaborative, Web-based data-oriented applications.","authors":["Kurt D.
