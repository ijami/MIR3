{"id":220848162,"name":"Compressed Sensing-Based Inpainting of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Band 6 Using Adaptive Spectrum-Weighted Sparse Bayesian Dictionary Learning","abstraction":"A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is proposed where observed data Y is modelled as a linear superposition, G, of a potentially infinite number of hidden sources, X. Whether a given source is active for a specific data point is specified by an infinite binary matrix, Z. The resulting sparse representation allows increased data reduction compared to standard ICA. We define a prior on Z using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). We describe four variants of the model, with Gaussian or Laplacian priors on X and the one or two-parameter IBPs. We demonstrate Bayesian inference under these models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on synthetic and gene expression data and compare to standard ICA algorithms.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260623423_Compressed_Sensing-Based_Inpainting_of_Aqua_Moderate_Resolution_Imaging_Spectroradiometer_Band_6_Using_Adaptive_Spectrum-Weighted_Sparse_Bayesian_Dictionary_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230996489_A_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Image_Super-Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239938718_Bayesian_Unification_of_Sound_Source_Localization_and_Separation_with_Permutation_Resolution"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220279494_Fast_and_Robust_Fixed-Point_Algorithms_for_Independent_Component_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229647197_On_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Mixtures_With_an_Unknown_Number_of_Components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6265760_A_decomposition_model_to_track_gene_expression_signatures_Preview_on_observer-independent_classification_of_ovarian_cancer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227661917_Green_PJ_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixtures_with_an_unknown_number_of_components_with_discussion_J_Roy_Stat_Soc_B_59_731-792","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2242002_Independent_Component_Analysis_of_Electroencephalographic_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619194_Modeling_Dyadic_Data_with_Binary_Latent_Factors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2348531_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixture_with_unknown_number_of_components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2611505_A_New_Learning_Algorithm_for_Blind_Signal_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228373683_Bayesian_nonparametric_latent_feature_models"],"citedInIDs":[260623423,230996489,239938718],"refrenceIDs":[220279494,229647197,6265760,220270203,227661917,2242002,221619194,2348531,2611505,228373683],"pageRank":5.787435674664022E-4}
