{"id":260740370,"name":"Development of a semi-defined growth medium for Pedobacter cryoconitis BG5 using statistical experimental design","abstraction":"Various objects can be summarily described by probability distributions: groups of raw data, paths of stochastic processes, neighborhoods of an image pixel and so on. Dealing with nonparametric distributions, we propose a method for classifying such objects by estimating a finite mixture of Dirichlet distributions when the observed distributions are assumed to be outcomes of a finite mixture of Dirichlet processes. We prove the consistency of such a classification by using the mutual singularity of two distinct Dirichlet processes and the martingale convergence theorem. Moreover, this consistency allows us to use some standard data analysis and statistical methods for analyzing the class labels of these objects. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
