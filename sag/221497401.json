{"id":221497401,"name":"Old version","abstraction":"We consider the Multi-armed bandit problem under the PAC (\"probably approximately correct\") model. It was shown by Even-Dar et al. (5) that given n arms, it suces to play the arms a total of O (n\u003d\"2)log(1\u003d-) times to find an \"-optimal arm with probability of at least 1ยก-. Our contribution is a matching lower bound that holds for any sampling policy. We also generalize the lower bound to a Bayesian setting, and to the case where the statistics of the arms are known but the identities of the arms are not.","authors":["Shie Mannor"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275587982_Old_version","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273067644_Influence_Maximization_with_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263545276_Unimodal_Bandits_without_Smoothness"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220616937_The_Non-Stochastic_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239292007_Asymptotically_efficient_adaptive_allocation_rules1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3023642_Finite-Time_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Two-Armed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2265004_Gambling_in_a_rigged_casino_The_adversarial_multi-armed_bandit_problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221499155_Gambling_in_a_Rigged_Casino_The_Adversarial_Multi-Arm_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239064206_Asymptotically_optimal_procedures_for_sequential_adaptive_selection_of_the_best_of_several_normal_means","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244955528_A_Dynamic_Allocation_Index_for_the_Sequential_Design_of_Experiments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265459088_Sequential_Analysis_Tests_and_Confidence_Intervals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225176417_PAC_Bounds_for_Multi-armed_Bandit_and_Markov_Decision_Processes"],"citedInIDs":[275587982,273067644,263545276],"refrenceIDs":[220616937,239292007,3023642,220343796,2265004,221499155,239064206,244955528,265459088,225176417],"pageRank":6.084591538544757E-4}
