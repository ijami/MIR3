{"id":221012704,"name":"Injecting Logical Background Knowledge into Embeddings for Relation Extraction","abstraction":"Most Web-based Q/A systems work by find- ing pages that contain an explicit answer to a question. These systems are helpless if the answer has to be inferred from multiple sen- tences, possibly on different pages. To solve this problem, we introduce the HOLMES sys- tem, which utilizes textual inference (TI) over tuples extracted from text. Whereas previous work on TI (e.g., the lit- erature on textual entailment) has been ap- plied to paragraph-sized texts, HOLMES uti- lizes knowledge-based model construction to scale TI to a corpus of 117 million Web pages. Given only a few minutes, HOLMES doubles recall for example queries in three disparate domains (geography, business, and nutrition). Importantly, HOLMES\u0027s runtime is linear in the size of its input corpus due to a surprising property of many textual relations in the Web corpusâ€”they are \"approximately\" functional in a well-defined sense.","authors":["Oren Etzioni"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281380823_Injecting_Logical_Background_Knowledge_into_Embeddings_for_Relation_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013194_Learning_First-Order_Horn_Clauses_from_Web_Text","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012783_Quantifier_Scope_Disambiguation_Using_Extracted_Pragmatic_Knowledge_Preliminary_Results"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49940356_Automatic_Acquisition_of_Hyponyms_from_Large_Text_Corpora","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31441225_Introduction_to_WordNet_An_On-line_Lexical_Database","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231831552_From_knowledge_bases_to_decision_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221101606_Experiments_with_Open-Domain_Textual_Question_Answering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220814723_Open_Information_Extraction_from_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220515731_Scaling_Question_Answering_to_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221605763_Robust_Textual_Inference_Via_Learning_and_Abductive_Reasoning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221366753_The_PASCAL_Recognising_Textual_Entailment_Challenge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251507221_Natural_Logic_for_Textual_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225107426_An_Inference_Model_for_Semantic_Entailment_in_Natural_Language"],"citedInIDs":[281380823,221013194,221012783],"refrenceIDs":[49940356,31441225,231831552,221101606,220814723,220515731,221605763,221366753,251507221,225107426],"pageRank":5.783394597448971E-4}
