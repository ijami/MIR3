{"id":279633530,"name":"Markov chain Monte Carlo methods: an introductory example","abstraction":"Drawing a sample from a discrete distribution is one of the building components for Monte Carlo methods. Like other sampling algorithms, discrete sampling also suffers from high computational burden in large-scale inference problems. We study the problem of sampling a discrete random variable with a high degree of dependency that is typical in large-scale Bayesian inference and graphical models, and propose an efficient approximate solution with a subsampling approach. We make a novel connection between the discrete sampling and Multi-Armed Bandits problems with a finite reward population and provide three algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations show the robustness and efficiency of the approximate algorithms in both synthetic and real-world large-scale problems.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224175402_Scaling_the_iHMM_Parallelization_versus_Hadoop","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346425_Bayesian_Learning_via_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236235190_Austerity_in_MCMC_Land_Cutting_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Budget","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262350854_Monte_Carlo_MCMC_efficient_inference_by_approximate_sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286498_Slice_sampling_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2360567_Hoeffding_Races_Accelerating_Model_Selection_Search_for_Classification_and_Function_Approximation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259478458_lil%27_UCB_An_Optimal_Exploration_Algorithm_for_Multi-Armed_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357750_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_in_Sampling_without_Replacement"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[224175402,221346425,236235190,256606492,262350854,221618614,220286498,2360567,259478458,38357750],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
