{"id":38367709,"name":"A Generalization of Sampling Without Replacement From a Finite Universe","abstraction":"In a previous paper [2] it was shown that it is sometimes profitable to select sampling units with probability proportionate to size of the unit. This note indicates a method of determining the probabilities of selection which minimize the variance of the sample estimate at a fixed cost. Some approximations that have practical applications are given.","authors":["Morris H. Hansen","William N.
