The work of the second author was supported by DGES grant PB96-0300 0 1 Introduction The phenomenon of measure concentration has recently received distinguished attention due to its much better understanding and its spectacular power and simplicity in applications. The basic methods for proving concentration inequalities have been (1) martingale methods---see McDiarmid [22], [23] for excellent surveys; (2) information-theoretic methods, see Alhswede, G\u0027acs, and Korner [1], Marton [17], [18],[19], Dembo [5] and Massart [21]; (3) Talagrand\u0027s induction method [27],[25],[26], which led to a large variety of powerful new inequalities. Recently, a new proof technique emerged based on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, see Ledoux [14],[13]. The method has been shown to provide the sharpest i...","authors":["Ramon Trias Fargas"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26645330_Exponential_bounds_and_tails_for_additive_random_recursive_sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103433_Infimum-convolution_description_of_concentration_properties_of_product_probability_measures_with_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3085491_On_the_Eigenspectrum_of_the_Gram_Matrix_and_the_Generalization_Error_of_Kernel-PCA"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41709611_On_Talagrand%27s_deviation_inequalities_for_product_measure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200033835_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260303138_Structural_risk_minimization_over_data-dependent_hierarchies_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38351708_A_new_look_at_independence_Ann_Probab","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223249877_Nonnegative_entropy_measures_of_multivariate_symmetric_correlations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38351334_About_the_constants_in_talagrand%27s_concentration_inequalities_for_empirical_processes_Ann_Probab_282863-884_English_summary","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37594276_Logarithmic_Sobolev_inequalities_and_stochastic_Ising_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230675276_A_Probablistic_Theory_of_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2270590_On_the_Length_of_the_Longest_Monotone_Subsequence_in_a_Random_Permutation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244453272_An_inequality_related_to_the_isoperimetric_inequality"],"citedInIDs":[26645330,243103433,3085491],"refrenceIDs":[41709611,200033835,260303138,38351708,223249877,38351334,37594276,230675276,2270590,244453272],"pageRank":0.0011288795422544793}
