{"id":221012856,"name":"Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models","abstraction":"The end-to-end performance of natural language processing systems for com- pound tasks, such as question answering and textual entailment, is often hampered by use of a greedy 1-best pipeline archi- tecture, which causes errors to propagate and compound at each stage. We present a novel architecture, which models these pipelines as Bayesian networks, with each low level task corresponding to a variable in the network, and then we perform ap- proximate inference to find the best la- beling. Our approach is extremely sim- ple to apply but gains the benefits of sam- pling the entire distribution over labels at each stage in the pipeline. We apply our method to two tasks - semantic role la- beling and recognizing textual entailment - and achieve useful performance gains from the superior pipeline architecture.","authors":["Jenny Rose Finkel","Andrew Y.
