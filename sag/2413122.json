{"id":2413122,"name":"Sensitivity computation of the L1 minimization problem and its application to dictionary design","abstraction":"This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classication tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the `relevance vector machine\u0027 (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art `support vector machine\u0027 (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while oering a number of additional advantages. These include the benets of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of `nuisance\u0027 parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-`Mercer\u0027 kernels).","authors":["Alex Smola"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253300771_Sensitivity_computation_of_the_L1_minimization_problem_and_its_application_to_dictionary_design","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254700729_Fast_Bayesian_Matching_Pursuit_Model_Uncertainty_and_Parameter_Estimation_for_Sparse_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228337292_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_for_Bayesian_Variable_Selection"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2642765_Probabilistic_methods_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345107_Simplified_Support_Vector_Decision_Rules","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2836338_Comparison_of_Approximate_Methods_for_Handling_Hyperparameters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10832856_The_Connection_Between_Regularization_Operators_and_Support_Vector_Kernels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2456088_The_Evidence_Framework_Applied_to_Classification_Networks"],"citedInIDs":[253300771,254700729,228337292],"refrenceIDs":[2642765,221345107,2836338,10832856,2456088],"pageRank":0.0010368696849146024}
