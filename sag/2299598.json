{"id":2299598,"name":"Bayesian Variable Selection in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","abstraction":"We consider the problems of variable selection and accounting for model uncertainty in linear regression models. Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. The complete Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this paper we offer two alternative approaches. First we describe a Bayesian model selection algorithm called \"Occam\u0027s Window\" which involves averaging over a reduced set of models. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach which directly approximates the exact solution. Both these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than any single model which might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but there is no relationship between any...","authors":["Adrian Raftery","David Madigan","Jennifer Hoeting"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45114554_Bayesian_Variable_Selection_in_Cost-Effectiveness_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26638704_Seeking_for_the_rational_basis_of_the_Median_Model_The_optimal_combination_of_multi-model_ensemble_results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228925886_Smoothing_Balanced_Single-Error-Term_Analysis_of_Variance"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234262803_Data_Analysis_and_Regression_A_Second_Course_In_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261654839_Subset_Selection_in_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245581819_Bayes_Factors_and_Model_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242504973_Markov_Chains_with_Stationary_Probabilities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239065040_A_Note_on_Screening_Regression_Equations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239065043_The_Analysis_And_Selection_Of_Variables_In_Linear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247116263_Participation_in_illegitimate_activities_Ehrlich_revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37796538_Applied_Statistical_Decision_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24106822_Crime_and_Punishment_An_Economic_Aproach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766950_Reliability_of_subjective_probability_forecasts_of_precipitation_and_temperature_J_R_Stat_Soc_C_Appl_Stat"],"citedInIDs":[45114554,26638704,228925886],"refrenceIDs":[234262803,261654839,245581819,242504973,239065040,239065043,247116263,37796538,24106822,243766950],"pageRank":9.225956224315879E-4}
