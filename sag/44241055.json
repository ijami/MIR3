{"id":44241055,"name":"Nemirovski\u0027s Inequalities Revisited","abstraction":"In the simplest case, a data set consists of observations on a single variable, say real-valued observations. Suppose there are n such observations, denoted by X1, . . . ,Xn. For example, Xi could be the reaction time of individual i to a given stimulus, or the number of car accidents on day i, etc. Suppose now that each observation follows the same probability law P. This means that the observations are relevant if one wants to predict the value of a new observation X say (the reaction time of a hypothetical new subject, or the number of car accidents on a future day, etc.). Thus, a common underlying distribution P allows one to generalize the outcomes.","authors":["Magid Maatallah"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41911064_Nemirovski%27s_Inequalities_Revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2130013_Convergence_of_algorithms_for_reconstructing_convex_bodies_and_directional_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220259168_Simulation-based_Uniform_Value_Function_Estimates_of_Markov_Decision_Processes"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[41911064,2130013,220259168],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":7.397040499690528E-4}
