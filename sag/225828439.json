{"id":225828439,"name":"Efficient simulation of tail probabilities of sums of correlated lognormals","abstraction":"Monte Carlo methods comprise a large and still growing collection of methods of repetitive simulation designed to obtain approximate solutions of various problems by playing games of chance. Often these methods are motivated by randomness inherent in the problem being studied (as, e.g., when simulating the random walks of â€œparticlesâ€? undergoing diffusive transport), but this is not an essential feature of Monte Carlo methods. As long ago as the eighteenth century, the distinguished French naturalist Compte de Buffon [1] described an experiment that is by now well known: a thin needle of length l is dropped repeatedly on a plane surface that has been ruled with parallel lines at a fixed distance d apart. Then, as Laplace suggested many years later [2], an empirical estimate of the probability P of an intersection obtained by dropping a needle at random a large number, N, of times and observing the number, n, of intersections provides a practical means for estimating Ï€","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49514135_Efficient_simulation_of_tail_probabilities_of_sums_of_correlated_lognormals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248205629_Incorporation_of_statistical_length_scale_into_Weibull_strength_theory_for_composites","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245185082_Evaluating_small_failure_probabilities_of_multiple_limit_states_by_parallel_subset_simulation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367364_An_Extension_of_the_Buffon_Needle_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663964_A_New_Monte_Carlo_Technique_Antithetic_Variates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230262771_Random_Number_Generation_and_Quasi-Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663725_The_Monte_Carlo_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247329305_Random_number_generation_is_too_important_to_be_left_to_chance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220430805_Serial_Correlation_in_the_Generation_of_Pseudo-Random_Numbers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7187654_Random_Numbers_Fall_Mainly_in_the_Planes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238834277_Random_Number_Generators_and_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222468860_A_Review_of_Pseudorandom_Number_Generators","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220422221_Random_Numbers_for_Simulation"],"citedInIDs":[49514135,248205629,245185082],"refrenceIDs":[38367364,230663964,230262771,230663725,247329305,220430805,7187654,238834277,222468860,220422221],"pageRank":0.0022374642374470557}
