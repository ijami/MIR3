{"id":37992037,"name":"Measuring and Predicting Visual Importance of Similar Objects","abstraction":"Research in object detection and recognition in cluttered scenes requires large image collections with ground truth labels. The labels should provide information about the object classes present in each image, as well as their shape and locations, and possibly other attributes such as pose. Such data is useful for testing, as well as for supervised learning. This project provides a web-based annotation tool that makes it easy to annotate images, and to instantly sharesuch annotations with the community. This tool, plus an initial set of 10,000 images (3000 of which have been labeled), can be found at http://www.csail.mit.edu/$\\sim$brussell/research/LabelMe/intro.html","authors":["Bryan C.
