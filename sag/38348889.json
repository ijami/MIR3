{"id":38348889,"name":"A priori truncation method for posterior sampling from homogeneous normalized completely random measure mixture models","abstraction":"We consider the problem of determining the distribution of means of random probability measures which are obtained by normalizing increasing additive processes. A solution is found by resorting to a well-known inversion formula for characteristic functions due to Gurland. Moreover, expressions of the posterior distributions of those means, in the presence of exchangeable observations, are given. Finally, a section is devoted to the illustration of two examples of statistical relevance.","authors":["Igor Pr√ºnster"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280104095_A_priori_truncation_method_for_posterior_sampling_from_homogeneous_normalized_completely_random_measure_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277170252_Discussion_of_the_paper_Sequential_quasi-Monte_Carlo_sampling_by_M_Gerber_and_N_Chopin","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267570378_Beta-Negative_Binomial_Process_and_Exchangeable_Random_Partitions_for_Mixed-Membership_Modeling"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367787_Inversion_Formulae_for_the_Distribution_of_Ratios","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357812_Prior_Distributions_on_Spaces_of_Probability_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362605_Tailfree_and_Neutral_Random_Probabilities_and_Their_Posterior_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260161521_Approximate_Random_Variate_Generation_from_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231922366_Linear_functionals_and_Markov_chains_associated_with_Dirichlet_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358395_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Estimation_Based_on_Censored_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248073268_Theory_of_Multivariate_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230595873_Convergence_of_Probability_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38346612_Completely_random_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227705537_A_Full_Bayesian_Non-parametric_Analysis_Involving_a_Neutral_to_the_Right_Process"],"citedInIDs":[280104095,277170252,267570378],"refrenceIDs":[38367787,38357812,38362605,260161521,231922366,38358395,248073268,230595873,38346612,227705537],"pageRank":0.0010024208743383382}
