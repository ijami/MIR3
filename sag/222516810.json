{"id":222516810,"name":"General formalism for the efficient calculation of the Hessian matrix of EM data misfit and Hessian-vector products based upon adjoint sources approach","abstraction":"Truncated-Newton methods are a family of methods for solving large optimization problems. Over the past two decades, a solid convergence theory has been derived for the methods. In addition, many algorithmic enhancements have been developed and studied, resulting in a number of publicly available software packages. The result has been a collection of powerful, flexible, and adaptable tools for large-scale nonlinear optimization.","authors":["Stephen G.
