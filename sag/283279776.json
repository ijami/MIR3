{"id":283279776,"name":"Scaled subordinators and generalizations of the Indian buffet process","abstraction":"We study random families of subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ that are similar to exchangeable random partitions, but do not require constituent sets to be disjoint: Each element of ${\\mathbb{N}}$ may be contained in multiple subsets. One class of such objects, known as Indian buffet processes, has become a popular tool in machine learning. Based on an equivalence between Indian buffet and scale-invariant Poisson processes, we identify a random scaling variable whose role is similar to that played in exchangeable partition models by the total mass of a random measure. Analogous to the construction of exchangeable partitions from normalized subordinators, random families of sets can be constructed from randomly scaled subordinators. Coupling to a heavy-tailed scaling variable induces a power law on the number of sets containing the first $n$ elements. Several examples, with properties desirable in applications, are derived explicitly. A relationship to exchangeable partitions is made precise as a correspondence between scaled subordinators and Poisson-Kingman measures, generalizing a result of Arratia, Barbour and Tavare on scale-invariant processes.","authors":["Peter Orbanz","Yee Whye Teh"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265543899_On_the_central_role_of_scale_invariant_Poisson_processes_on_0","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265357735_Random_discrete_distributions_Discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24163428_Taking_Advantage_of_Sparsity_in_Multi-Task_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619128_Nonparametric_Latent_Feature_Models_for_Link_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5323469_Latent_Features_in_Similarity_Judgments_A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321006_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Analyzing_and_Sorting_Large_Databases_of_Sequential_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223803147_Order_statistics_for_jumps_of_normalised_subordinators","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2826951_The_Two_Parameter_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_Derived_From_a_Stable_Subordinator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270095_The_Infinite_Gamma-Poisson_Feature_Model"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[265543899,220270203,265357735,24163428,221619128,5323469,3321006,223803147,2826951,220270095],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
