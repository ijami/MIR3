{"id":2295809,"name":"Correction to â€œThe Importance of Convexity in Learning With Squared Lossâ€? [Sep 98 1974-1980]","abstraction":". We consider learning on multi-layer neural nets with piecewise polynomial activation functions and a fixed number k of numerical inputs. We exhibit arbitrarily large network architectures for which efficient and provably successful learning algorithms exist in the rather realistic refinement of Valiant\u0027s model for probably approximately correct learning (\"PAC-learning\") where no a-priori assumptions are required about the \"target function\" (agnostic learning), arbitrary noise is permitted in the training sample, and the target outputs as well as the network outputs may be arbitrary reals. The number of computation steps of the learning algorithm LEARN that we construct is bounded by a polynomial in the bit-length n of the fixed number of input variables, in the bound s for the allowed bit-length of weights, in 1 \" , where \" is some arbitrary given bound for the true error of the neural net after training, and in 1 ffi where ffi is some arbitrary given bound for the probability t...","authors":["Wolfgang Maass"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3087002_Correction_to_The_Importance_of_Convexity_in_Learning_With_Squared_Loss_Sep_98_1974-1980","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11555985_Schmitt_M_On_the_Complexity_of_Computing_and_Learning_with_multiplicative_Neural_Networks_Neural_Computation_142_241-301","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2424863_Training_a_Sigmoidal_Node_Is_Hard"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222190436_Decision_Theoretic_Generalizations_of_the_PAC_Model_for_Neural_Net_and_Other_Learning_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220430853_Learnability_and_the_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_dimension_J_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226468516_Training_a_3-node_neural_network_is_NP-complete","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable_Commun_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3505541_Efficient_Distribution-free_Learning_of_Probabilistic_Concepts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2686822_Cryptographic_Limitations_on_Learning_Boolean_Formulae_and_Finite_Automata","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497447_Equivalence_of_Models_for_Polynomial_Learnability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497807_Bounding_the_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_Dimension_of_Concept_Classes_Parameterized_by_Real_Numbers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226947811_Toward_Efficient_Agnostic_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220467907_On_the_complexity_of_computing_determinants"],"citedInIDs":[3087002,11555985,2424863],"refrenceIDs":[222190436,220430853,226468516,234793335,3505541,2686822,221497447,221497807,226947811,220467907],"pageRank":8.367008493787069E-4}
