{"id":278048794,"name":"Estimating point centrality using different network sampling techniques","abstraction":"In the past few years, the storage and analysis of large-scale and fast evolving networks present a great challenge. Therefore, a number of different techniques have been proposed for sampling large networks. In general, network exploration techniques approximate the original networks more accurately than random node and link selection. Yet, link selection with additional subgraph induction step outperforms most other techniques. In this paper, we apply subgraph induction also to random walk and forest-fire sampling. We analyze different real-world networks and the changes of their properties introduced by sampling. We compare several sampling techniques based on the match between the original networks and their sampled variants. The results reveal that the techniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering distribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original networks. Techniques without subgraph induction step exhibit exactly the opposite behavior. Hence, the performance of the sampling techniques from random selection category compared to network exploration sampling does not differ significantly, while clear differences exist between the techniques with subgraph induction step and the ones without it.","authors":["Lovro Å ubelj"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224384171_Metropolis_Algorithms_for_Representative_Subgraph_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229430161_A_new_algorithm_for_extracting_a_small_representative_subgraph_from_avery_large_graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274967410_Sampling_promotes_community_structure_in_social_and_information_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200110781_Sampling_from_large_graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7291347_Statistical_properties_of_sample_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264123922_Assessing_the_effectiveness_of_real-world_network_simplification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254639513_Network_Sampling_via_Edge-based_Node_Selection_with_Graph_Induction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266654163_Metric_convergence_in_social_network_sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7966400_Subnets_of_scale-free_networks_are_not_scale-free_sampling_properties_of_networks_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258048563_Reconsidering_the_Foundations_of_Network_Sampling"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[224384171,229430161,274967410,200110781,7291347,264123922,254639513,266654163,7966400,258048563],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
