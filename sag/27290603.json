{"id":27290603,"name":"Bayesian Modeling of Temporal Dependence in Large Sparse Contingency Tables","abstraction":"This article presents two Gibbs sampling methods for é t- ting Bayesian nonparametric and semiparametric hierarchical models that are based on a general class of priors that we call stick-breaking priors. The two types of Gibbs samplers are quite different in nature. The é rst method is applicable when the prior can be characterized by a generalized Pólya urn mechanism and it involves drawing samples from the poste- rior of a hierarchical model formed by marginalizing over the prior. Our Pólya urn Gibbs sampler is a direct extension of the widely used Pólya urn sampler developed by Escobar (1988, 1994), MacEachern (1994), and Escobar and West (1995) for","authors":["Hemant Iswaran"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259989855_Bayesian_Modeling_of_Temporal_Dependence_in_Large_Sparse_Contingency_Tables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257299216_MCMC_for_Normalized_Random_Measure_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234113987_A_Sequential_Algorithm_for_Fast_Fitting_of_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060446_Estimating_the_means_of_several_normal_populations_by_estimating_the_distribution_of_the_means_PhD_thesis_Yale_University","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226400696_Size-biased_sampling_of_Poisson_point_processes_and_excursions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250796429_Distribution_of_the_mean_value_for_certain_random_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243771125_A_Model_for_the_Distribution_of_Individuals_by_Species_in_an_Environment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243771126_The_Continuum_of_Inductive_Methods_Revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245451632_Applications_of_the_Two-Parameter_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_Ph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261620586_Approximate_Dirichlet_Process_Computing_in_Finite_Normal_Mixtures"],"citedInIDs":[259989855,257299216,234113987],"refrenceIDs":[229100346,229100417,239060446,226400696,250796429,243771125,243771126,2741222,245451632,261620586],"pageRank":0.0027943257848697576}
