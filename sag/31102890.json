{"id":31102890,"name":"Bayesian Nonparametric Density Estimation under Length Bias","abstraction":"A new kernel density estimator for length biased data which derives from smoothing the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is proposed and investigated. It has various advantages over an alternative method suggested by Bhattacharyya, Franklin \u0026 Richardson (1988): it is necessarily a probability density, it is particularly better behaved near zero, it has better asymptotic mean integrated squared error properties and it is more readily extendable to related problems such as density derivative estimation.","authors":["M.
