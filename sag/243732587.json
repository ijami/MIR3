{"id":243732587,"name":"Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks","abstraction":"An adaptive neural network with asymmetric connections is introduced. This network is related to the Hopfield network with graded neurons and uses a recurrent generalization of the Î´ rule of Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams to modify adaptively the synaptic weights. The new network bears a resemblance to the master/slave network of Lapedes and Farber but it is architecturally simpler.","authors":["Fernando J.
