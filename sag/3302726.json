{"id":3302726,"name":"Study on Support Vector Machine Combined with Infrared Spectroscopy for Timber Species Identification","abstraction":"In this paper we give a new fast iterative algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) classifier design. The basic problem treated is one that does not allow classification violations. The problem is converted to a problem of computing the nearest point between two convex polytopes. The suitability of two classical nearest point algorithms, due to Gilbert, and Mitchell et al., is studied. Ideas from both these algorithms are combined and modified to derive our fast algorithm. For problems which require classification violations to be allowed, the violations are quadratically penalized and an idea due to Cortes and Vapnik and Friess is used to convert it to a problem in which there are no classification violations. Comparative computational evaluation of our algorithm against powerful SVM methods such as Platt\u0027s sequential minimal optimization shows that our algorithm is very competitive","authors":["S.S.
