{"id":288179574,"name":"Research on high-performance algorithm for pseudolite air based positioning","abstraction":"We consider convergence properties of particle filters with Gaussian importance distributions for certain time-varying Poisson regression models. We analyze both the classical bounded-importance-weight condition and a more recent moment condition. We show that Gaussian importance distributions based on Laplace approximations or non-linear Kalman filters lead to particle filters that are not guaranteed to converge. We also suggest avoiding the problem by a certain split-Gaussian modification that naturally arises from ensuring bounded weights. Although in this paper we concentrate on the time-varying Poisson regression model, we argue that our findings have implications in more general particle filtering problems.","authors":["Juho Kokkala"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38339872_Central_limit_theorem_for_nonlinear_filtering_and_interacting_particle_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287422283_Weight_moment_conditions_for_L4_convergence_of_particle_filters_for_unbounded_test_functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3318241_A_Survey_of_Convergence_Results_on_Particle_Filtering_Methods_for_Practitioners","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4895745_Bayesian_Inference_in_Econometric_Models_Using_Monte_Carlo_Integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319722_Quasi-Monte_Carlo_filtering_in_nonlinear_dynamic_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286119652_On_the_L4_convergence_of_particle_filters_with_general_importance_distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267173362_Fundamentals_of_Stochastic_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5097550_The_Multivariate_Split_Normal_Distribution_and_Asymmetric_Principal_Components_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224718050_Sampling_Densities_of_Particle_Filter_A_Survey_and_Comparison","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744518_Sequential_Monte-Carlo_Methods_in_Practice"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[38339872,287422283,3318241,4895745,3319722,286119652,267173362,5097550,224718050,200744518],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
