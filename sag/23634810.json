{"id":23634810,"name":"Exponential bounds for the hypergeometric distribution","abstraction":"We build optimal exponential bounds for the probabilities of large deviations of sums Sn\u003d[summation operator]1n Xi of independent Bernoulli random variables from their mean n[mu]. These bounds depend only on the sample size n. Our results improve previous results obtained by Hoeffding and, more recently, by Talagrand. We also prove a global stochastic order dominance for the Binomial law and shows how this gives a new explanation of Hoeffding\u0027s results.","authors":["Carlos A.
