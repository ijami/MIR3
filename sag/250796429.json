{"id":250796429,"name":"Generalized weighted Chinese restaurant processes for species sampling mixture models","abstraction":"Let r be a probability measure on [0,1]. We consider a generalization of the classic Dirichlet process- the random probability measure F \u003d ~ P~Sx~, where X \u003d {Xi} is a sequence of independent random variables with the common distribution r and P \u003d {P~} is independent of X and has the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution PD(c~, ~) on the unit simplex. The main result is the formula connecting the distribution I ~ of the random mean value f xdF(x) with the parameter measure r. Bibliography: 12 titles.","authors":["N. V.
