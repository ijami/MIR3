{"id":38360165,"name":"Localized Rademacher Complexities","abstraction":"The regression model $\\mathbf{y} \u003d g(\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{\\varepsilon}$ and least-squares estimation are studied in a general context. By making use of empirical process theory, it is shown that entropy conditions on the class $\\mathscr{G}$ of possible regression functions imply $L^2$-consistency of the least-squares estimator $\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}_n$ of $g$. This result is applied in parametric and nonparametric regression.","authors":["Sara Van De Geer"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2402407_Localized_Rademacher_Complexities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2758361_Consistency_for_the_Least_Squares_Estimator_in_Non-Parametric_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348686_Consistency_for_the_least_squares_estimator_in_nonparametric_regression"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[2402407,2758361,38348686],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":7.357707677275691E-4}
