{"id":247011232,"name":"Accelerating Metropolis-Hastings algorithms by Delayed Acceptance","abstraction":"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are currently enjoying a surge of interest within the statistical community. The goal of this work is to formalize and support two distinct adaptive strategies that typically accelerate the convergence of an MCMC algorithm. One approach is through resampling; the other incorporates adaptive switching of the transition kernel. Support is both by analytic arguments and simulation study. Application is envisioned in low-dimensional but nontrivial problems. Two pathological illustrations are presented. Connections with reparameterization are discussed as well as possible difficulties with infinitely often adaptation.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273157850_Accelerating_Metropolis-Hastings_algorithms_by_Delayed_Acceptance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228337292_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_for_Bayesian_Variable_Selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43500657_Adaptive_independence_samplers"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910629_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_Calculate_Marginal_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363224_Inference_From_Iterative_Simulation_Using_Multiple_Sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235361263_Bayesian_Statistics_Without_Tears_A_Sampling-Resampling_Perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246784422_Maximum-likelihood_estimation_for_constrained-_or_missing-data_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357609_Markov_Chains_for_Exploring_Posterior_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246972427_Nonparametric_Density_Estimation_The_L1_View","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363225_Practical_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Stat_Sci_7_473-483","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31403274_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_Using_Markov_Chains_and_Their_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245943504_DISCUSSION_ON_THE_MEETING_ON_THE_GIBBS_SAMPLER_AND_OTHER_MARKOV_CHAIN-MONTE_CARLO_METHODS","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227424526_Simple_conditions_for_the_convergence_of_the_Gibbs_sampler_and_Metropolis-Hastings_algorithm"],"citedInIDs":[273157850,228337292,43500657],"refrenceIDs":[224910629,38363224,235361263,246784422,38357609,246972427,38363225,31403274,245943504,227424526],"pageRank":9.548801697400847E-4}
