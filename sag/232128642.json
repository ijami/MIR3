{"id":232128642,"name":"Bioassessment in complex environments: Designing an index for consistent meaning in different settings","abstraction":"This paper presents a general technique for the treatment of samples drawn without replacement from finite universes when unequal selection probabilities are used. Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional assumptions.* Journal Paper No. J2139 of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa, Project 1005.
