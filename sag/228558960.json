{"id":228558960,"name":"A Focused Crawler Combinatory Link and Content Model Based on T-Graph Principles","abstraction":"ARACHNID is a distributed algorithm for in-formation discovery in large, dynamic, dis-tributed environments such as the World Wide Web. The approach is based on a dis-tributed, adaptive population of intelligent agents making local decisions. The behavior of the algorithm is analyzed using a simpliied model of the Web environment. This analysis highlights an interesting feature of the Web environment that bodes well for ARACH-NID\u0027s search methods. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated using both sim-ulated environments and preliminary experi-ments in which prototype agents search real Web environments. Interactions are also dis-cussed between unsupervised learning by in-dividual agents and evolution at the popula-tion level, along with the role played in both by user relevance feedback.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236985144_A_Focused_Crawler_Combinatory_Link_and_Content_Model_Based_on_T-Graph_Principles","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281210262_A_Focused_Crawler_Combinatory_Link_and_Content_Model_Based_on_T-Graph_Principles","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221006757_Revisiting_Evolutionary_Information_Filtering"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2947676_Artificial_Life_Applied_to_Adaptive_Information_Agents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3593413_Evolving_agents_for_personalized_information_filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2264726_Amalthaea_Information_Discovery_and_Filtering_using_a_Multiagent_Evolving_Ecosystem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2555259_WebWatcher_A_Learning_Apprentice_for_the_World_Wide_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2787342_A_Comparison_of_Parallel_and_Sequential_Niching_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233967787_Information_Retrieval_Data_Structures_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220445542_Information_Retrieval_in_the_World-Wide_Web_Making_Client-Based_Searching_Feasible","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2436904_Learning_Information_Retrieval_Agents_Experiments_with_Automated_Web_Browsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224945038_Personal_Communication","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220421912_Agents_that_Reduce_Work_and_Information_Overload"],"citedInIDs":[236985144,281210262,221006757],"refrenceIDs":[2947676,3593413,2264726,2555259,2787342,233967787,220445542,2436904,224945038,220421912],"pageRank":0.0012456472153131737}
