{"id":2837747,"name":"On the Topology of the double spherical pendulum","abstraction":"When a Hamiltonian system has a \"Kinetic + Potential\" structure, the resulting flow is locally a geodesic flow. But there may be singularities of the geodesic structure; so the local structure does not always imply that the flow is globally a geodesic flow. In order for a flow to be a geodesic flow, the underlying manifold must have the structure of a unit tangent bundle. We develop homological conditions for a manifold to have such a structure. We apply these criteria to several classical examples: a particle in a potential well, the double spherical pendulum, the Kovalevskaya top, and the N-body problem. We show that the flow of the reduced planar N-body problem and the reduced spatial 3-body are never geodesic flows except when the angular momentum is zero and the energy is positive.","authors":["Christopher Mccord"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236844229_On_the_Topology_of_the_double_spherical_pendulum","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47864325_Toric_Integrable_Geodesic_Flows_in_Odd_Dimensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242684380_Geodatengleichung_und_Hamilton-Formalismus"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27294977_Lectures_on_Algebraic_Topology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2458627_On_the_Homology_of_the_Integral_Manifolds_in_the_Planar_N-Body_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227017523_Two-body_motion_under_the_inverse_square_central_force_and_equivalent_geodesic_flows","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226812567_Cross_Sections_in_the_Three-Body_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239538739_Hamiltonian_Dynamical_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226392985_Topology_of_the_Integral_Manifolds_of_the_N-Body_Problem_with_Positive_Energy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238233774_Fomenko_invariants_for_the_main_integrable_cases_of_the_rigid_body_motion_equations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247040526_On_the_Geometry_of_the_Kepler_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46185640_Reduction_of_Symplectic_Manifolds_with_Symmetry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246534197_Invariant_manifolds_in_the_motion_of_a_rigid_body_about_a_fixed_point"],"citedInIDs":[236844229,47864325,242684380],"refrenceIDs":[27294977,2458627,227017523,226812567,239538739,226392985,238233774,247040526,46185640,246534197],"pageRank":6.214746105468066E-4}
