{"id":220816756,"name":"Conditional Random Field Autoencoders for Unsupervised Structured Prediction","abstraction":"We investigate prototype-driven learning for pri- marily unsupervised sequence modeling. Prior knowledge is specified declaratively, by provid- ing a few canonical examples of each target an- notation label. This sparse prototype information is then propagated across a corpus using distri- butional similarity features in a log-linear gener- ative model. On part-of-speech induction in En- glish and Chinese, as well as an information extrac- tion task, prototype features provide substantial er- ror rate reductions over competitive baselines and outperform previous work. For example, we can achieve an English part-of-speech tagging accuracy of 80.5% using only three examples of each tag and no dictionary constraints. We also compare to semi-supervised learning and discuss the system\u0027s error trends.","authors":["Dan Klein"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267869732_Conditional_Random_Field_Autoencoders_for_Unsupervised_Structured_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259875389_Controlling_Complexity_in_Part-of-Speech_Induction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262275429_A_Cost_Sensitive_Part-of-Speech_Tagging_Differentiating_Serious_Errors_from_Minor_Errors"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221102892_Building_a_Large-Scale_Annotated_Chinese_Corpus","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873139_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Field_Segmentation_Models_for_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2534662_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Stochastic_Context-Free_Grammars_using_Distributional_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228057706_Indexing_By_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873283_Contrastive_Estimation_Training_Log-Linear_Models_on_Unlabeled_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226174686_On_the_Limited_Memory_BFGS_Method_for_Large_Scale_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228734693_Morphological_features_help_POS_tagging_of_unknown_words_across_language_varieties","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984124_Rabiner_L_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition_Proc_IEEE_772_257-286","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank"],"citedInIDs":[267869732,259875389,262275429],"refrenceIDs":[221102892,220873139,2534662,228057706,220873283,226174686,228734693,2984124,220017637],"pageRank":8.75296611552137E-4}
