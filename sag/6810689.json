{"id":6810689,"name":"Computational evolution of decision-making strategies","abstraction":"Human perception and memory are often explained as optimal statistical inferences that are informed by accurate prior probabilities. In contrast, cognitive judgments are usually viewed as following error-prone heuristics that are insensitive to priors. We examined the optimality of human cognition in a more realistic context than typical laboratory studies, asking people to make predictions about the duration or extent of everyday phenomena such as human life spans and the box-office take of movies. Our results suggest that everyday cognitive judgments follow the same optimal statistical principles as perception and memory, and reveal a close correspondence between people\u0027s implicit probabilistic models and the statistics of the world.","authors":["Thomas L Griffiths","Joshua B Tenenbaum"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281522765_Computational_evolution_of_decision-making_strategies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274095955_A_Bayesian_framework_for_knowledge_attribution_Evidence_from_semantic_integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265135474_Where_did_that_come_from-Identifying_the_source_of_a_sample"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7852402_The_Origins_of_Bursts_and_Heavy_Tails_in_Human_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19533174_Toward_a_Universal_Law_of_Generalization_for_Psychological_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12084637_Edge_co-occurence_in_natural_images_predicts_contour_grouping_performance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11824716_Natural_image_statistics_and_neural_representation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202304359_Utility_Probability_and_Human_Decision_Making","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10577254_Rational_models_as_theories_-_Not_standards_-_Of_behavior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12117984_Perception_and_preference_in_short-term_word_priming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8918059_Bayesian_integration_in_sensorimotor_learning_Nature","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15058942_The_generic_viewpoint_assumption_in_a_framework_for_visual_perception","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11349724_Motion_Illusions_as_Optimal_Percepts"],"citedInIDs":[281522765,274095955,265135474],"refrenceIDs":[7852402,19533174,12084637,11824716,202304359,10577254,12117984,8918059,15058942,11349724],"pageRank":6.068513488154751E-4}
