{"id":221605263,"name":"A Probabilistic Approach to Knowledge Translation","abstraction":"Reasoning with both probabilistic and deterministic depen- dencies is important for many real-world problems, and in particular for the emerging field of statistical relational learn- ing. However, probabilistic inference methods like MCMC or belief propagation tend to give poor results when deter- ministic or near-deterministic dependencies are present, and logical ones like satisfiability testing are inapplicable t o prob- abilistic ones. In this paper we propose MC-SAT, an infer- ence algorithm that combines ideas from MCMC and satis- fiability. MC-SAT is based on Markov logic, which defines Markov networks using weighted clauses in first-order logic . From the point of view of MCMC, MC-SAT is a slice sampler with an auxiliary variable per clause, and with a satisfiabil ity- based method for sampling the original variables given the auxiliary ones. From the point of view of satisfiability, MC- SAT wraps a procedure around the SampleSAT uniform sam- pler that enables it to sample from highly non-uniform distr i- butions over satisfying assignments. Experiments on entit y resolution and collective classification problems show tha t MC-SAT greatly outperforms Gibbs sampling and simulated tempering over a broad range of problem sizes and degrees of determinism.","authors":["Hoifung Poon","Pedro Domingos"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280062181_A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Knowledge_Translation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282179802_Stream_Mining_Using_Statistical_Relational_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269040593_Lifted_Probabilistic_Inference_for_Asymmetric_Graphical_Models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233871591_New_Advances_in_Inference_by_Recursive_Conditioning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247752095_The_Alchemy_system_for_statistical_relational_AI","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239067001_Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2482843_Efficient_Clustering_of_High-Dimensional_Data_Sets_with_Application_to_Reference_Matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215990907_Markov_Logic_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222943831_On_the_hardness_of_approximate_reasoning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4914136_Gibbs_Sampling_for_Bayesian_Non-Conjugate_and_Hierarchical_Models_by_Using_Auxiliary_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221604192_Using_weighted_MAX-SAT_engines_to_solve_MPE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237104492_Marko_Chain_Monte_Carlo_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221605831_Discriminative_Training_of_Markov_Logic_Networks"],"citedInIDs":[280062181,282179802,269040593],"refrenceIDs":[233871591,247752095,239067001,2482843,215990907,222943831,4914136,221604192,237104492,221605831],"pageRank":0.0012284028494040223}
