{"id":259987194,"name":"Error Analysis of Coefficient-Based Regularized Algorithm for Density-Level Detection","abstraction":"Estimating the Rademacher chaos complexity of order two is important for understanding the performance of multikernel learning (MKL) machines. In this letter, we develop a novel entropy integral for Rademacher chaos complexities. As compared to the previous bounds, our result is much improved in that it introduces an adjustable parameter Îµ to prohibit the divergence of the involved integral. With the use of the iteration technique in Steinwart and Scovel (2007), we also apply our Rademacher chaos complexity bound to the MKL problems and improve existing learning rates.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235006197_Error_Analysis_of_Coefficient-Based_Regularized_Algorithm_for_Density-Level_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274318210_Refined_Generalization_Bounds_of_Gradient_Learning_over_Reproducing_Kernel_Hilbert_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282969709_Generalization_Analysis_of_Multi-Modal_Metric_Learning"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742228_Convexity_Classification_and_Risk_Bounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24052721_New_approaches_to_statistical_learning_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221992588_Learning_rates_of_multi-kernel_regularized_regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1760118_Fast_rates_for_support_machines_using_Guassian_kernels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695275_The_covering_number_in_learning_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319995_Covering_Number_Bounds_of_Certain_Regularized_Linear_Function_Classes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202066243_A_General_and_Efficient_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896334_Learning_the_kernel_function_via_regularization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320954_Learnability_of_Gaussians_with_Flexible_Variances","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2852039_A_Few_Notes_on_Statistical_Learning_Theory"],"citedInIDs":[235006197,274318210,282969709],"refrenceIDs":[4742228,24052721,221992588,1760118,222695275,220319995,202066243,32896334,220320954,2852039],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
