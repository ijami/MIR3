{"id":31403274,"name":"Soil properties control decomposition of soil organic carbon: Results from data-assimilation analysis","abstraction":"SUMMARY A generalization of the sampling method introduced by Metropolis et al. (1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties of assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices and potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed.","authors":["W.
