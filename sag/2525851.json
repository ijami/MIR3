{"id":2525851,"name":"ENN: Extended Nearest Neighbor Method for Pattern Recognition [Research Frontier]","abstraction":"Approximate Bayesian Gaussian process (GP) classification techniques are powerful nonparametric learning methods, similar in appearance and performance to Support Vector machines. Based on simple probabilistic models, they render interpretable results and can be embedded in Bayesian frameworks for model selection, feature selection, etc. In this paper, by applying the PAC-Bayesian theorem of McAllester (1999), we prove distributionfree generalization error bounds for a wide range of approximate Bayesian GP classification techniques. We instantiate and test these bounds for two particular GPC techniques, including a sparse method which circumvents the unfavourable scaling of standard GP algorithms.","authors":["Matthias Seeger"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280222761_ENN_Extended_Nearest_Neighbor_Method_for_Pattern_Recognition_Research_Frontier","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270906449_An_Improvement_to_the_Domain_Adaptation_Bound_in_a_PAC-Bayesian_context","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264545756_On_the_Generalization_of_the_C-Bound_to_Multiclass_Setting"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226130690_Multivariate_statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220690726_Information_Theory_for_Continuous_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239931544_Numerial_Recipies_in_C_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245581819_Bayes_Factors_and_Model_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260303138_Structural_risk_minimization_over_data-dependent_hierarchies_IEEE_Trans_Inf_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2533271_Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3084582_A_PAC-Bayesian_margin_bound_for_linear_classifiers_why_SVMs_work","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222715292_Numerical_Recipes_in_C","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215755923_In_Numerical_Receipts_in_C_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234786663_Fast_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines_Using_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization"],"citedInIDs":[280222761,270906449,264545756],"refrenceIDs":[226130690,220690726,239931544,245581819,260303138,2533271,3084582,222715292,215755923,234786663],"pageRank":7.232207362780647E-4}
