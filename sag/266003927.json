{"id":266003927,"name":"Convergence rate of weak Local Linearization schemes for stochastic differential equations with additive noise","abstraction":"This paper proposes a new statistical method of estimation and simulation for systems of stochastic differential equations. By using this method, we can easily derive a discretised process from a system of stochastic differential equations. The discretised process is tractable enough to simulate the system and to construct the likelihood which is used to estimate the coefficients of the stochastic differential equations from discrete observations.","authors":["Isao Shoji"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259399548_Convergence_rate_of_weak_Local_Linearization_schemes_for_stochastic_differential_equations_with_additive_noise","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38350899_Local_linear_approximations_of_jump_diffusion_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241214537_Weak_local_linear_discretizations_for_stochastic_differential_equations"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31327023_Estimating_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_Efficiently_by_Minimum_Chi-Square","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255482463_Brownian_Motion_and_Stochastic_Calculus","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227815122_Comparative_study_of_estimation_methods_for_continuous_time_stochastic_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256504631_The_Numerical_Solution_of_Stochastic_Differential_Equations"],"citedInIDs":[259399548,38350899,241214537],"refrenceIDs":[31327023,255482463,227815122,256504631],"pageRank":5.922421574143218E-4}
