{"id":5106090,"name":"Zonoids, Linear Dependence, and Size-Biased Distributions on the Simplex","abstraction":"Based on Jewitt (1986) we try to find a characterization of comparative downside risk aversion and love. The desired characterizations involve the decomposition of the dual of the intersection of two convexity cones. The decomposition holds in the case of downside risk love, but not in the case of downside risk aversion. A counterexample is provided.","authors":["Salvatore Modica"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106127_Zonoids_Linear_Dependence_and_Size-Biased_Distributions_on_the_Simplex","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106091_Existence_of_solutions_and_asset_pricing_bubbles_in_general_equilibrium_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24058793_Positive_value_of_information_in_games"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4980093_Credit_Rationing_Wealth_Inequality_and_Allocation_of_Talent","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222520566_Certainty_Independence_and_the_Separation_of_Utility_and_Beliefs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22861727_Functional_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222651769_A_Characterization_of_the_Core_of_Convex_Games_Through_Gateaux_Derivatives","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222582578_Expected_Utility_Theory_Without_the_Completeness_Axiom","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2362707_A_Subjective_Spin_on_Roulette_Wheels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2524007_Ambiguity_From_The_Differential_Viewpoint","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106093_Bivariate_Option_Pricing_with_Copulas","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106095_Pricing_Vulnerable_Options_With_Copulas","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106135_Wealth_Polarization_and_Pulverization_in_Fractal_Societies"],"citedInIDs":[5106127,5106091,24058793],"refrenceIDs":[4980093,222520566,22861727,222651769,222582578,2362707,2524007,5106093,5106095,5106135],"pageRank":0.0011435013851729505}
