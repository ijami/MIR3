{"id":228855445,"name":"A Multilevel Acceleration for L1 -regularized Logistic Regression","abstraction":"Logistic regression with 1 regularization has been proposed as a promising method for feature selection in classification problems. In this paper we describe an efficient interior-point method for solving large-scale 1 -regularized logistic regression problems. Small problems with up to a thousand or so features and examples can be solved in seconds on a PC; medium sized problems, with tens of thousands of features and examples, can be solved in tens of seconds (assuming some sparsity in the data). A variation on the basic method, that uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient method to compute the search step, can solve very large problems, with a million features and ex-amples (e.g., the 20 Newsgroups data set), in a few minutes, on a PC. Using warm-start techniques, a good approximation of the entire regularization path can be computed much more efficiently than by solving a family of problems independently.","authors":["Kwangmoo Koh","Seung-Jean Kim","Stephen Boyd"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283791376_A_Multilevel_Acceleration_for_L1_-regularized_Logistic_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283211221_IJDATS_Logistic_Regression_Rare_Events","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282403164_Distributionally_Robust_Logistic_Regression"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320087_A_Modified_Finite_Newton_Method_for_Fast_Solution_of_Large_Scale_Linear_SVMs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320333_Boosting_as_a_Regularized_Path_to_a_Maximum_Margin_Classifier","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228612687_-Regularization_Path_Algorithm_for_Generalized_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345661_Convex_optimization_techniques_for_fitting_sparse_Gaussian_graphical_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225873905_Truncated_Newton_algorithms_for_large-scale_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224514087_Efficient_Minimization_Methods_of_Mixed_l2-l1_and_l1-l1_Norms_for_Image_Restoration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805287_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996122_The_Entire_Regularization_Path_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264955448_Least_Angle_Regression_with_discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235016623_User%27s_Guide_for_NPSOL_Version_40_a_Fortran_Program_for_Nonlinear_Programming"],"citedInIDs":[283791376,283211221,282403164],"refrenceIDs":[220320087,220320333,228612687,221345661,225873905,224514087,2805287,221996122,264955448,235016623],"pageRank":6.458565520961562E-4}
