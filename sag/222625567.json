{"id":222625567,"name":"Learning Using Large Datasets","abstraction":"We formalize a notion of loading information into connectionist networks that characterizes the training of feed-forward neural networks. This problem is NP-complete, so we look for tractable subcases of the problem by placing constraints on the network architecture. The focus of these constraints is on various families of â€œshallowâ€? architectures which are defined to have bounded depth and un-bounded width. We introduce a perspective on shallow networks, called the Support Cone Interaction (SCI) graph, which is helpful in distinguishing tractable from intractable subcases: When the SCI graph is a tree or is of limited bandwidth, loading can be accomplished in polynomial time; when its bandwidth is not limited we find the problem NP-complete even if the SCI graph is a simple 2-dimensional planar grid.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236736803_Learning_Using_Large_Datasets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11042143_Multi-objective_cooperative_coevolution_of_artificial_neural_networks_multi-objective_cooperative_networks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220618236_Planar_formulae_and_their_uses_SIAM_J_Comput","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221591393_Bandwidth_Constrained_NP-Complete_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220695890_Computers_and_Intractability_A_Guide_To_The_Theory_of_NP-Completeness","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246668287_Learning_in_Networks_is_Hard","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230595972_Complexity_Results_for_Bandwidth_Minimization"],"citedInIDs":[236736803,221618614,11042143],"refrenceIDs":[220618236,221591393,220695890,246668287,230595972],"pageRank":0.001626779289036971}
