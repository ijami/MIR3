{"id":222505227,"name":"One-inclusion hypergraph density revisited","abstraction":"We generalize Sauer\u0027s lemma to multivalued functions, proving tight bounds on the cardinality of subsets of âˆ?i \u003d 1m {0, â€¦, Nm} which avoid certain patterns. In addition, we give an application of this result, bounding the uniform rate of convergence of empirical estimates of the expectations of a set of random variables to their true expectations.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220113538_One-inclusion_hypergraph_density_revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250135352_On_the_VC-dimension_and_Boolean_functions_with_long_runs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222538281_Time_series_prediction_with_single_multiplicative_neuron_model"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220430853_Learnability_and_the_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_dimension_J_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242792882_Induced_subsets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239543612_Lecture_Notes_in_Mathematics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable_Commun_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220194489_Dart_calculus_of_induced_subsets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222784754_On_the_density_of_sets_of_vectors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236736807_Estimation_of_Dependences_Based_on_Empirical_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256157935_Forbidden_submatrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222200978_A_forbidden_configuration_theorem_of_Alon"],"citedInIDs":[220113538,250135352,222538281],"refrenceIDs":[220430853,242792882,239543612,234793335,220194489,222784754,233784971,236736807,256157935,222200978],"pageRank":0.0012004459224593908}
