{"id":260429900,"name":"Paliperidone extended-release tablets in Chinese patients with schizophrenia: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","abstraction":"Evaluation of long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of paliperidone extended-release (pali ER), in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. In this parallel-group, relapse prevention, phase-3 study (screening [14-day], pali ER open-label run-in [8-week] and stabilization [6-week] phases, and double-blind (DB) treatment [variable duration], and open-label extension phases [24-week]), 136/201 patients with schizophrenia were randomized (1:1) to pali ER (3-12mg) or placebo during the DB phase. Final analysis showed that, out of 135 patients in ITT (DB) population, 71 (52.6%) had a relapse event, 45 (33.3%) were ongoing at the time the study was stopped, and 19 (14.1%) discontinued from the DB phase. Time to relapse (primary endpoint) favored pali ER (hazard ratio\u003d5.23 [95% CI: 2.96, 9.25], p \u003c0.0001). Rate of relapses (55/71 [77.5%] placebo; 16/64 [25%] pali ER) and secondary endpoints (change from baseline in positive and negative syndrome scale [PANSS] and clinical global impression-severity scores) were significantly lower (p\u003c0.001) in pali ER group vs placebo, in favor of pali ER. More psychiatric-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in placebo- (21.1%) than pali ER group (10.9%). Most common (\u003e3%) TEAEs in placebo group were insomnia and schizophrenia (8.5% each), while in pali ER group were aggression and akathisia (4.7% each), and schizophrenia, tremor, nausea, amenorrhoea, and salivary hypersecretion (3.1% each). All serious TEAEs were psychiatric-related (schizophrenia, aggression, completed suicide, auditory hallucination, suicide attempt) and more frequent in placebo- (11.3%) versus pali ER group (3.1%). Death and tardive dyskinesia-related discontinuation (n\u003d1 each) occurred in placebo group. Body weight increase from run-in baseline was greater in pali ER group (mean increase: 3.90kg) versus placebo (mean increase: 2.05kg). This study confirms the findings from earlier pali ER global relapse-prevention studies and demonstrates that pali ER treatment (3-12mg) is efficacious over the long-term and significantly delays relapse in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. No new safety signals were detected in this population.","authors":["Rui Qing","Wang Yang","Liang Shu","Wu Yue","Wu Qingqi"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281817865_Paliperidone_extended-release_tablets_in_Chinese_patients_with_schizophrenia_Meta-analysis_of_randomized_controlled_trials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284711751_Attitudes_toward_Placebo-Controlled_Clinical_Trials_of_Patients_with_Schizophrenia_in_Japan"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42767930_Change_of_psychotropic_drug_prescription_for_schizophrenia_in_a_psychiatric_institution_in_Beijing_China_between_1999_and_2008","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223135315_A_one-year_prospective_study_of_the_safety_tolerability_and_pharmacokinetics_of_the_highest_available_dose_of_paliperidone_palmitate_in_patients_with_schizophrenia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228098786_Flexible_dosing_with_paliperidone_ER_in_the_treatment_of_patients_with_acutely_exacerbated_schizophrenia_Results_from_a_single-arm_open-label_study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19595229_Approximately_Optimal_One-Parameter_Boundaries_for_Group_Sequential_Trials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11580019_A_Comparison_of_Risperidone_and_Haloperidol_for_the_Prevention_of_Relapse_in_Patients_with_Schizophrenia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10899142_Aripiprazole_A_review_of_its_pharmacology_and_clinical_use","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11095042_Kane_JM_Carson_WH_Saha_AR_McQuade_RD_Ingenito_GG_Zimbroff_DL_et_al_Efficacy_and_safety_of_aripiprazole_and_haloperidol_vs_placebo_in_patients_with_schizophrenia_and_schizoaffective_disorder_J_Clin_Psy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7873982_Risperidone_and_Haloperidol_in_First-Episode_Psychosis_A_Long-Term_Randomized_Trial","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6271083_Commentary_Race_and_mental_health_-_More_questions_than_answers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23317005_Efficacy_and_safety_of_oral_paliperidone_extended-release_tablets_in_the_treatment_of_acute_schizophrenia_Pooled_data_from_three_52-week_open-label_studies"],"citedInIDs":[281817865,284711751],"refrenceIDs":[42767930,223135315,228098786,19595229,11580019,10899142,11095042,7873982,6271083,23317005],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
