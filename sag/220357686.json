{"id":220357686,"name":"The Martingale Approach for Concentration and Applications in Information Theory, Communications and Coding","abstraction":"Inequalities for martingales with bounded differences have recently proved to be very useful in combinatorics and in the mathematics of operational research and computer science. We see here that these inequalities extend in a natural way to with bounded differences, and thus include, for example, better inequalities for sequences related to sampling without replacement.","authors":["Colin McDiarmid"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51955780_The_Martingale_Approach_for_Concentration_and_Applications_inInformation_Theory_Communications_and_Coding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51934759_Transient_analysis_of_the_subordinated_chain_of_a_state_dependent_purebirth_process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51934122_A_stochastic_model_for_distributed_real_time_streaming_-_Evolution_ofthe_network_structure"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23629875_Classes_of_Orderings_of_Measures_and_Related_Correlation_Inequalities-II_Multivariate_Reverse_Rule_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220459353_The_Expected_Distribution_of_Degrees_in_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23632947_A_Concept_of_Negative_Dependence_Using_Stochastic_Ordering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361748_Some_Concepts_of_Negative_Dependence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358951_Negative_Association_of_Random_Variables_With_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222452792_The_analysis_of_a_fringe_heuristic_for_binary_search_trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36343238_On_some_concepts_of_dependence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220618365_Determining_the_Stability_Number_of_a_Graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688500_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_III_Sorting_and_Searching"],"citedInIDs":[51955780,51934759,51934122],"refrenceIDs":[23629875,221996154,220459353,23632947,38361748,38358951,222452792,36343238,220618365,220688500],"pageRank":0.0014446046535177132}
