{"id":2522353,"name":"Factorial Hidden Markov Models for Learning Representations of Natural Language","abstraction":"We present a framework for learning in hidden Markov models with distributed state representations. Within this framework, we derive a learning algorithm based on the Expectation--Maximization (EM) procedure for maximum likelihood estimation. Analogous to the standard Baum-Welch update rules, the M-step of our algorithm is exact and can be solved analytically.However, due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, the exact E-step is intractable. A simple and tractable mean field approximation is derived. Empirical results on a set of problems suggest that both the mean field approximation and Gibbs sampling are viable alternatives to the computationally expensive exact algorithm.","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259440872_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Learning_Representations_of_Natural_Language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257527705_INDiC_Improved_Non-intrusive_Load_Monitoring_Using_Load_Division_and_Calibration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259334958_Dropout_Improves_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Handwriting_Recognition"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3249683_An_introduction_to_hidden_Markov_models_IEEE_ASSP_Mag","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2263315_Exploiting_Tractable_Substructures_in_Intractable_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2754791_Boltzmann_Chains_and_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2439047_Autoencoders_Minimum_Description_Length_and_Helmholtz_Free_Energy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223927652_Connectionist_learning_of_belief_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619832_Factorial_Learning_and_the_EM_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14896130_Hidden_Markov_Models_of_Biological_Primary_Sequence_Information","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239039429_Mean_eld_networks_that_learn_to_discriminate_temporally_distorted_strings"],"citedInIDs":[259440872,257527705,259334958],"refrenceIDs":[3249683,2263315,2754791,2439047,223927652,221619832,14896130,239039429],"pageRank":6.822292677168824E-4}
