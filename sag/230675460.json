{"id":230675460,"name":"Computation of a function of a matrix with close eigenvalues by means of the Newton interpolating polynomial","abstraction":"In principle, the exponential of a matrix could be computed in many ways. Methods involving approximation theory, differential equations, the matrix eigenvalues, and the matrix characteristic polynomial have been proposed. In practice, consideration of computational stability and efficiency indicates that some of the methods are preferable to others but that none are completely satisfactory. Most of this paper was originally published in 1978. An update, with a separate bibliography, describes a few recent developments.","authors":["Charles Van Loan"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260232530_Computation_of_a_function_of_a_matrix_with_close_eigenvalues_by_means_of_the_Newton_interpolating_polynomial","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280104225_Matrix_functions_based_on_Chebychev_expansion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281858556_Higher_order_graph_centrality_measures_for_Neo4j"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3439840_An_Algorithm_for_Generating_Constituent_Matrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260578276_Matrix_functions_and_applications_Part_IV_-_Matrix_functions_and_constituent_matrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226513517_On_the_zeros_and_poles_of_Pad_approximants_toe_z_III","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3026052_A_novel_method_of_evaluating_eAt_in_closed_form","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226204560_Bounds_and_perturbation_bounds_for_the_matrix_exponential","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3440172_The_Measure_of_a_Matrix_as_a_Tool_to_Analyze_Computer_Algorithms_for_Circuit_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244473172_Numerical_Computation_of_the_Matrix_Exponential_with_Accuracy_Estimate","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3396809_Comment_on_Rational_approximants_to_the_matrix_exponentialA_and_reply","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243007955_On_exptA_with_A_satisfying_a_polynomial","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2991871_A_Note_on_the_Evaluation_of_an_Analytical_Function_of_a_Companion_Matrix_with_Distinct_Eigenvalues"],"citedInIDs":[260232530,280104225,281858556],"refrenceIDs":[3439840,260578276,226513517,3026052,226204560,3440172,244473172,3396809,243007955,2991871],"pageRank":0.0010669462629706858}
