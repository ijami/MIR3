Thesis Magdalen College, Oxford Michaelmas Term, 1997 Mixture distributions are typically used to model data in which each observation is assumed to have arisen from one of a number of different groups. They also provide a convenient and flexible class of models for density estimation. While a Bayesian analysis of mixture models has certain advantages over a classical approach, it is not without its problems. In theory quantities of interest may be written down as integrals, but in practice these integrals cannot be done analytically. When the number of groups in the data is assumed known, the Gibbs sampler can be used to perform this integration numerically, but the non-identifiability of the mixture model parameters causes label-switching in the Gibbs sampler output and makes inference for the individual components of the mixture meaningless. We show that the usual method of dealing with this problem (i...","authors":["Matthew Stephens"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280773824_Bayesian_mixtures_of_spatial_spline_regressions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273157850_Accelerating_Metropolis-Hastings_algorithms_by_Delayed_Acceptance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270906042_Dirichlet_Process_Parsimonious_Mixtures_for_clustering"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100480_Statistical_Analysis_of_Finite_Mixture_DistributionsJohn_Wiley_Sons_New_York","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2682821_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Convergence_Diagnostics_A_Comparative_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM%27s","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243763126_Estimation_of_Finite_Mixture_Distributions_Through_Bayesian_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242503284_The_Calculation_of_Posterior_Distributions_by_Data_Augmentation_Rejoinder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237104492_Marko_Chain_Monte_Carlo_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764505_Bayesian_Model_Choice_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764509_Marginal_likelihood_from_the_Gibbs_output_J_Am_Stat_Assoc","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233801150_Springer_Series_in_Statistics"],"citedInIDs":[280773824,273157850,270906042],"refrenceIDs":[2670104,229100480,2682821,220682848,243763126,242503284,237104492,243764505,243764509,233801150],"pageRank":6.470931482051624E-4}
