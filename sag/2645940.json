In this case, x j (t) is the concentration of the drug in the jth compartment at time t, while the elements of A are the transfer rates between the compartments. See [4] and [1, Chapter 5]. If the matrix A is diagonalizable, then the matrix exponential can be viewed as transforming the eigenvalues while leaving the eigenvectors unchanged.
