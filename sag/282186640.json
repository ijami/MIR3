{"id":282186640,"name":"Towards More Realistic Projections of Soil Carbon Dynamics by Earth System Models","abstraction":"Soil properties, such as clay content, are hypothesized to control decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, these hypotheses of soil property-C decomposition relationships have not been explicitly tested at large spatial scales. Here, we used a data-assimilation approach to evaluate the roles of soil properties and environmental factors in regulating decomposition of SOC. A three-pool (active, slow, and passive) C-cycling model was optimally fitted with 376 published laboratory incubation data from soils acquired from 73 sites with mean annual temperature ranging from -. 15 to 26. Â°C. Our results showed that soil physical and chemical properties regulated decomposition rates of the active and the slow C pools. Decomposition rates were lower for soils with high clay content, high field water holding capacity (WHC), and high C:N ratio. Multifactor regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses showed that clay content was the most important variable in regulating decomposition of SOC. In contrast to the active and slow C pools, soil properties or environmental factors had little effect on the decomposition of the passive C pool. Our results show inverse soil property-C decomposition relationships and quantitatively evaluate the essential roles of soil texture (clay content) in controlling decomposition of SOC at a large spatial scale. The results may help model development and projection of changes in terrestrial C sequestration in the future.","authors":["Zheng Shi"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287346604_Towards_More_Realistic_Projections_of_Soil_Carbon_Dynamics_by_Earth_System_Models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222646645_Baldock_J_A_Skjemstad_J_O_Role_of_the_matrix_and_minerals_in_protecting_natural_organic_materials_against_biological_attack_Org_Geochem_31_697-710","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222552982_Relationship_of_soil_organic_matter_dynamics_to_physical_protection_and_tillage_Soil_Till_Res_53_215-230","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238114882_Evaluating_and_Testing_Models_of_Terrestrial_Biogeochemistry_The_Role_of_Temperature_in_Controlling_Decomposition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227340135_Sensitivity_of_organic_matter_decomposition_to_warming_varies_with_its_quality_Glob_Chang_Biol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47761899_Craine_JM_Fierer_N_McLauchlan_KK_Widespread_coupling_between_the_rate_and_temperature_sensitivity_of_organic_matter_decay_Nature_Geosci_3_854-857","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280901256_The_response_of_heterotrophic_activity_and_carbon_cycling_to_nitrogen_additions_and_warming_in_two_tropical_soils","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229061712_Potential_Carbon_Release_from_Permafrost_Soils_of_Northeastern_Siberia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227157788_Enriquez_S_C_M_Duarte_and_K_Sand-Jensen_Patterns_in_decomposition_rates_among_photosynthetic_organisms_the_importance_of_detritus_CNP_content_Oecologia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200152319_Tree_Species_and_Soil_Textural_Controls_on_Carbon_and_Nitrogen_Mineralization_Rates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234036719_The_Role_of_Soil_Characteristics_on_TemperatureSensitivity_of_Soil_Organic_Matter"],"citedInIDs":[287346604],"refrenceIDs":[222646645,222552982,238114882,227340135,47761899,280901256,229061712,227157788,200152319,234036719],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
