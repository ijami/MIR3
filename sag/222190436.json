{"id":222190436,"name":"The Learnability of Unknown Quantum Measurements","abstraction":"We describe a generalization of the PAC learning model that is based on statistical decision theory. In this model the learner receives randomly drawn examples, each example consisting of an instance x ∈ X and an outcome y ∈ Y, and tries to find a decision rule h: X → A, where h ∈ , that specifies the appropriate action a ∈ A to take for each instance x in order to minimize the expectation of a loss l(y, a). Here X, Y, and A are arbitrary sets, l is a real-valued function, and examples are generated according to an arbitrary joint distribution on X × Y. Special cases include the problem of learning a function from X into Y, the problem of learning the conditional probability distribution on Y given X (regression), and the problem of learning a distribution on X (density estimation). We give theorems on the uniform convergence of empirical loss estimates to true expected loss rates for certain decision rule spaces , and show how this implies learnability with bounded sample size, disregarding computational complexity. As an application, we give distribution-independent upper bounds on the sample size needed for learning with feedforward neural networks. Our theorems use a generalized notion of VC dimension that applies to classes of real-valued functions, adapted from Vapnik and Pollard\u0027s work, and a notion of capacity and metric dimension for classes of functions that map into a bounded metric space.","authors":["David Haussler"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270515202_The_Learnability_of_Unknown_Quantum_Measurements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233871440_Small-Size_Relative_pEpsilon-Approximations_for_Well-Behaved_RangeSpaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263790633_ESTIMATING_THE_APPROXIMATION_ERROR_IN_LEARNING_THEORY"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220452657_epsilon-Nets_and_Simplex_Range_Queries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222453050_Quantifying_inductive_bias_AI_learning_algorithms_and_Valiant%27s_learning_framework_Artif_Intell","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable_Commun_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497426_A_General_Lower_Bound_on_the_Number_of_Examples_Needed_for_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497447_Equivalence_of_Models_for_Polynomial_Learnability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232568297_Pattern-recognizing_stochastic_learning_automata","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220344008_Queries_and_Concept_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247645578_Statistical_theory_of_learning_a_rule","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343611_Learning_From_Noisy_Examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3498822_Predicting_0_1-functions_on_randomly_drawn_points"],"citedInIDs":[270515202,233871440,263790633],"refrenceIDs":[220452657,222453050,234793335,221497426,221497447,232568297,220344008,247645578,220343611,3498822],"pageRank":0.006303000360919453}
