{"id":228445426,"name":"Gaussian process surrogates for failure detection: a Bayesian experimental design approach","abstraction":"The estimation of small probabilities of failure from computer simulations is a classical problem in engineering, and the Subset Simulation algorithm proposed by Au \u0026 Beck (Prob. Eng. Mech., 2001) has become one of the most popular method to solve it. Subset simulation has been shown to provide significant savings in the number of simulations to achieve a given accuracy of estimation, with respect to many other Monte Carlo approaches. The number of simulations remains still quite high however, and this method can be impractical for applications where an expensive-to-evaluate computer model is involved. We propose a new algorithm, called Bayesian Subset Simulation, that takes the best from the Subset Simulation algorithm and from sequential Bayesian methods based on kriging (also known as Gaussian process modeling). The performance of this new algorithm is illustrated using a test case from the literature. We are able to report promising results. In addition, we provide a numerical study of the statistical properties of the estimator.","authors":["Ling Li","Julien Bect","Emmanuel Vazquez"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281895996_Gaussian_process_surrogates_for_failure_detection_a_Bayesian_experimental_design_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228438518_Fast_Parallel_Kriging-Based_Stepwise_Uncertainty_Reduction_With_Application_to_the_Identification_of_an_Excursion_Set","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241707735_Kriging-based_adaptive_Importance_Sampling_algorithms_for_rare_event_estimation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226031060_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_for_rare_event_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227615641_Probabilistic_sensitivity_analysis_of_complex_models_A_Bayesian_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224840090_Interpolation_of_Spatial_Data_Some_Theory_For_Kriging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228721976_Limit_theorems_for_weighted_samples_with_applications_to_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237548813_Choosing_the_Sample_Size_of_a_Computer_Experiment_A_Practical_Guide","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242922491_Bayesian_Approach_to_Global_Optimization--Theory_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4288587_On_Resampling_Algorithms_for_Particle_Filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4015429_New_resampling_algorithms_for_particle_filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265574083_Design_and_analysis_of_computer_experiments_With_comments_and_a_rejoinder_by_the_authors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216301381_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Experiments"],"citedInIDs":[281895996,228438518,241707735],"refrenceIDs":[226031060,227615641,224840090,228721976,237548813,242922491,4288587,4015429,265574083,216301381],"pageRank":6.219006299049484E-4}
