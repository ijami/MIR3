{"id":283892783,"name":"A deconvolution path for mixtures","abstraction":"Bayesian finite mixture modelling is a flexible parametric modelling approach for classification and density fitting. Many areas of application require distinguishing asignal from a noise component. In practice, it is often difficult to justify a specific distribution for the signal component; therefore, the signal distribution is usually further modelled via a mixture of distributions. However, modelling the signal as a mixture of distributions is computationally non-trivial due to the difficulties in justifying the exact number of components to be used and due to the label switching problem. This paper proposes the use of a non-parametric distribution to model thesignal component. We consider the case of discrete data and show how this new methodology leads to more accurate parameter estimation and smaller false non-discovery rate. Moreover, it does not incur the label switching problem. We show an application of the method to data generated by ChIP-sequencing experiments.","authors":["Yoshiko Hayashi"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35752214_Mixture_of_Dirichlet_processes_with_applications_to_Bayesian_nonparametric_problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245581955_Bayesian_Inference_for_Mixture_The_Label_Switching_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243763126_Estimation_of_Finite_Mixture_Distributions_Through_Bayesian_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45288467_Ernst_J_Kellis_M_Discovery_and_characterization_of_chromatin_states_for_systematic_annotation_of_the_human_genome_Nat_Biotechnol_28_817-825","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47425677_A_Statistical_Framework_for_the_Analysis_of_ChIP-Seq_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257701892_Hierarchical_Mixture_Models_in_Neurological_Transmission_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262269639_Minimum_profile_Hellinger_distance_estimation_for_a_semiparametric_mixture_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2675235_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Mixture_Models_With_an_Unknown_Number_of_Components_-_An_Alternative_to_Reversible_Jump_Methods"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[35752214,245581955,243763126,45288467,38357634,2670104,47425677,257701892,262269639,2675235],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
