{"id":279309788,"name":"A hidden Markov model approach to analyze longitudinal ternary outcomes when some observed states are possibly misclassified","abstraction":"Factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs) are powerful tools of modeling sequential data. Learning FHMMs yields a challenging simultaneous model selection issue, i.e., selecting the number of multiple Markov chains and the dimensionality of each chain. Our main contribution is to address this model selection issue by extending Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian (FAB) inference to FHMMs. First, we offer a better approximation of marginal log-likelihood than the previous FAB inference. Our key idea is to integrate out transition probabilities, yet still apply the Laplace approximation to emission probabilities. Second, we prove that if there are two very similar hidden states in an FHMM, i.e. one is redundant, then FAB will almost surely shrink and eliminate one of them, making the model parsimonious. Experimental results show that FAB for FHMMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art nonparametric Bayesian iFHMM and Variational FHMM in model selection accuracy, with competitive held-out perplexity.","authors":["Ryohei Fujimaki"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34000771_Variational_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236157548_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7561342_Discriminating_between_rate_heterogeneity_and_interspecific_recombination_in_DNA_sequence_alignments_with_phylogenetic_factorial_hidden_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2441249_One_Microphone_Source_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873077_Jointly_Labeling_Multiple_Sequences_A_Factorial_HMM_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27474033_Variational_Bayesian_analysis_for_hidden_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617836_The_Infinite_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095670_Variational_Inference_in_Non-negative_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Models_forEfficient_Audio_Source_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245123229_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241721344_Negative_Moments_of_Positive_Random_Variables"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[34000771,236157548,7561342,2441249,220873077,27474033,221617836,228095670,245123229,241721344],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
