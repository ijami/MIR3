{"id":221617647,"name":"Learning Structured Models for Segmentation of 2-D and 3-D Imagery","abstraction":"We present a globally convergent method for regularized risk minimization problems. Our method applies to Support Vector estimation, regression, Gaussian Processes, and any other regularized risk minimization setting which leads to a convex optimization problem. SVMPerf can be shown to be a special case of our approach. In addition to the unified framework we present tight convergence bounds, which show that our algorithm converges in O(1/ɛ) steps to ɛ precision for general convex problems and in O(log(1/ɛ)) steps for continuously differentiable problems. We demonstrate in experiments the performance of our approach. 1","authors":["Alex J. Smola","S. V. N. Vishwanathan","Quoc V.
