{"id":284096861,"name":"Accelerating pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings by correlating auxiliary variables","abstraction":"The use of unbiased estimators within the Metropolis--Hastings has found numerous applications in Bayesian statistics. The resulting so-called pseudo-marginal algorithm allows us to substitute an unbiased Monte Carlo estimator of the likelihood for the true likelihood which might be intractable or too expensive to compute. Under regularity conditions, it has been established that an efficient implementation of this algorithm requires the variance of the estimator of the log-likelihood ratio appearing in the acceptance probability of the pseudo-marginal algorithm to be of order 1 for $T$ data points as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, which in turn typically requires scaling the number $N$ of Monte Carlo samples linearly with $T$. We propose a simple and widely applicable modification of the pseudo-marginal algorithm, termed the correlated pseudo-marginal algorithm, which relies on an estimator of the log-likelihood ratio whose variance is shown to be of order $1$ as $N,T\\rightarrow\\infty$ whenever $N/T\\rightarrow0$. Experimentally, the efficiency of computations is increased relative to the standard pseudo-marginal algorithm by up to 180-fold in our simulations.","authors":["Arnaud Doucet","Michael K.
