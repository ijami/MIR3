{"id":267960550,"name":"Pororobot: A Deep Learning Robot That Plays Video Q\u0026A Games","abstraction":"We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif-ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.","authors":["Alex Krizhevsky","Ilya Sutskever","Geoffrey E Hinton"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281859715_Pororobot_A_Deep_Learning_Robot_That_Plays_Video_QA_Games","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291331681_Deep_Learning_the_Dynamic_Appearance_and_Shape_of_Facial_Action_Units","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283716595_Deep_learning_is_a_good_steganalysis_tool_when_embedding_key_is_reused_for_different_images_even_if_there_is_a_cover_sourcemismatch"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792705_What_is_the_Best_Multi-Stage_Architecture_for_Object_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40443832_A_High-Throughput_Screening_Approach_to_Discovering_Good_Forms_of_Biologically_Inspired_Visual_Representation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344904_Convolutional_deep_belief_networks_for_scalable_unsupervised_learning_of_hierarchical_representations_In_Proc_intl_conf_on_machine_learning_ICML","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37992037_LabelMe_A_Database_and_Web-Based_Tool_for_Image_Annotation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220520181_Lessons_from_the_Netflix_prize_challenge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220860992_Best_Practices_for_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_Applied_to_Visual_Document_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221376179_Convolutional_Networks_and_Applications_in_Vision","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4082304_Learning_methods_for_generic_object_recognition_with_invariance_to_pose_and_lighting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220016377_High-dimensional_signature_compression_for_large-scale_image_classification"],"citedInIDs":[281859715,291331681,283716595],"refrenceIDs":[216792705,40443832,221344904,37992037,220520181,220860992,221345737,221376179,4082304,220016377],"pageRank":0.00219752780619171}
