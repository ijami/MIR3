{"id":281548989,"name":"Short-term electric load forecasting using echo state networks and PCA decomposition","abstraction":"The current big data deluge requires innovative solutions for performing efficient inference on large, heterogeneous amounts of information. Apart from the known challenges deriving from high volume and velocity, real-world big data applications may impose additional technological constraints, including the need for a fully decentralized training architecture. While several alternatives exist for training feed-forward neural networks in such a distributed setting, less attention has been devoted to the case of decentralized training of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we propose such an algorithm for a class of RNNs known as Echo State Networks. The algorithm is based on the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers optimization procedure. It is formulated only in terms of local exchanges between neighboring agents, without reliance on a coordinating node. Additionally, it does not require the communication of training patterns, which is a crucial component in realistic big data implementations. Experimental results on large scale artificial datasets show that it compares favorably with a fully centralized implementation, in terms of speed, efficiency and generalization accuracy.","authors":["Massimo Panella"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282428374_Short-term_electric_load_forecasting_using_echo_state_networks_and_PCA_decomposition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281677244_Prediction_of_telephone_calls_load_using_Echo_State_Network_with_exogenous_variables"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245025935_Chapter_7_Distributed_Detection_and_Estimation_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220416607_Distributed_Optimization_and_Statistical_Learning_via_the_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234011781_Reservoir_computing_and_extreme_learning_machines_for_non-linear_time-series_data_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5598777_On-line_learning_algorithms_of_locally_recurrent_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221932955_Diffusion_Recursive_Least-Squares_for_Distributed_Estimation_Over_Adaptive_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264864242_Convex_Optimization_for_Big_Data_Scalable_randomized_and_parallel_algorithms_for_big_data_analytics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617998_Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266225209_Large_Scale_Distributed_Deep_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225307742_Sparse_Distributed_Learning_Based_on_Diffusion_Adaptation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220321057_Consensus-Based_Distributed_Support_Vector_Machines"],"citedInIDs":[282428374,281677244],"refrenceIDs":[245025935,220416607,234011781,5598777,221932955,264864242,221617998,266225209,225307742,220321057],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
