{"id":236736791,"name":"Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians","abstraction":"Let $M(x)$ denote the expected value at level $x$ of the response to a certain experiment. $M(x)$ is assumed to be a monotone function of $x$ but is unknown to the experimenter, and it is desired to find the solution $x \u003d \\theta$ of the equation $M(x) \u003d \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a given constant. We give a method for making successive experiments at levels $x_1,x_2,\\cdots$ in such a way that $x_n$ will tend to $\\theta$ in probability.","authors":["Herbert Robbins","Sutton Monro"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289587906_Variational_Inference_A_Review_for_Statisticians","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287643037_D4L_Decentralized_Dynamic_Discriminative_Dictionary_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287643496_Proximity_Without_Consensus_in_Online_Multi-Agent_Optimization"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[289587906,287643037,287643496],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":0.0012220798892612127}
