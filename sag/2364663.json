{"id":2364663,"name":"The cut-and-paste process","abstraction":"This paper introduces a split-and-merge transformation of interval partitions which combines some features of one model studied by Gnedin and Kerov [10, 11] and another studied by Tsilevich [30, 29] and Mayer-Wolf, Zeitouni and Zerner [20]. The invariance under this split-and-merge transformation of the interval partition generated by a suitable Poisson process yields a simple proof of the recent result of [20] that a Poisson-Dirichlet distribution is invariant for a closely related fragmentation-coagulation process. Uniqueness and convergence to the invariant measure are established for the split-and-merge transformation of interval partitions, but the corresponding problems for the fragmentation-coagulation process remain open.
