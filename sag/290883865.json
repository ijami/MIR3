{"id":290883865,"name":"Intelligent information processing for building university knowledge base","abstraction":"Estimating the confidence for a link is a critical task for Knowledge Graph construction. Link prediction, or predicting the likelihood of a link in a knowledge graph based on prior state is a key research direction within this area. We propose a Latent Feature Embedding based link recommendation model for prediction task and utilize Bayesian Personalized Ranking based optimization technique for learning models for each predicate. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, we also study the performance of the link prediction algorithm in terms of topological properties of the Knowledge Graph and present a linear regression model to reason about its expected level of accuracy.","authors":["Sutanay Choudhury","Xia Ning","Khushbu Agarwal"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266660388_Constructing_and_mining_web-scale_knowledge_graphs_KDD_2014_tutorial","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265594303_Typed_Tensor_Decomposition_of_Knowledge_Bases_for_Relation_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50235557_Natural_Language_Processing_Almost_from_Scratch","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221273612_Multi-relational_Link_Prediction_in_Heterogeneous_Information_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266660245_Knowledge_vault_A_web-scale_approach_to_probabilistic_knowledge_fusion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261040931_Link_Prediction_and_Recommendation_across_Heterogeneous_Social_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254006381_Predicting_RDF_triples_in_incomplete_knowledge_bases_with_tensor_factorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220421973_Open_Information_Extraction_from_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247169563_Pfe_er_Learning_probabilistic_relational_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277289291_Link_Prediction_Using_Supervised_Learning"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[266660388,265594303,50235557,221273612,266660245,261040931,254006381,220421973,247169563,277289291],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
