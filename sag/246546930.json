{"id":246546930,"name":"Impact of Clustering on the Performance of Network De-anonymization","abstraction":"People today typically use multiple online social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, etc.). Each online network represents a subset of their \"real\" ego-networks. An interesting and challenging problem is to reconcile these online networks, that is, to identify all the accounts belonging to the same individual. Besides providing a richer understanding of social dynamics, the problem has a number of practical applications. At first sight, this problem appears algorithmically challenging. Fortunately, a small fraction of individuals explicitly link their accounts across multiple networks; our work leverages these connections to identify a very large fraction of the network. Our main contributions are to mathematically formalize the problem for the first time, and to design a simple, local, and efficient parallel algorithm to solve it. We are able to prove strong theoretical guarantees on the algorithm\u0027s performance on well-established network models (Random Graphs, Preferential Attachment). We also experimentally confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm on synthetic and real social network data sets.","authors":["Nitish Korula"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280912238_Impact_of_Clustering_on_the_Performance_of_Network_De-anonymization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959326_On_the_Reliability_of_Profile_Matching_Across_Large_Online_Social_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268819755_De-anonymizing_scale-free_social_networks_by_percolation_graph_matching"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653663_It%27s_who_you_know_Graph_mining_using_recursive_structural_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222695255_The_cover_time_of_the_preferential_attachment_graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258128848_On_the_Performance_of_Percolation_Graph_Matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221261140_Interweaving_Public_User_Profiles_on_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236124441_Potential_Networks_Contagious_Communities_and_Understanding_Social_Network_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221590191_Affiliation_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653511_On_the_Privacy_of_Anonymized_Networks"],"citedInIDs":[280912238,277959326,268819755],"refrenceIDs":[221653663,222695255,258128848,221261140,236124441,221590191,221653511],"pageRank":6.023786362425671E-4}
