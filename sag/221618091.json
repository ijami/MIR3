{"id":221618091,"name":"LAIM discretization for multi-label data","abstraction":"We propose probabilistic generative models, called parametric mix- ture models (PMMs), for multiclass, multi-labeled text categoriza- tion problem. Conventionally, the binary classication approach has been employed, in which whether or not text belongs to a cat- egory is judged by the binary classier for every category. In con- trast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive ecien t learning and prediction algo- rithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signican tly outperform the conventional binary methods when ap- plied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages.","authors":["Kazumi Saito"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282938718_LAIM_discretization_for_multi-label_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270337594_A_Tutorial_on_Multi-Label_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272566091_Scalable_extensions_of_the_ReliefF_algorithm_for_weighting_and_selecting_features_on_the_multi-label_learning_context"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721756_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221613897_Inductive_learning_algorithms_and_representations_for_text_categorization_Proceedings_of_ACM-CIKM_1998","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2249086_A_Comparison_of_Two_Learning_Algorithms_for_Text_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2379828_Combining_Statistical_Learning_with_a_Knowledge-Based_Approach_-_A_Case_Study_in_Intensive_Care_Monitoring","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45622657_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2454668_A_Comparative_Study_on_Feature_Selection_in_Text_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226507886_Text_Classification_from_Labeled_and_Unlabeled_Documents_using_EM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"],"citedInIDs":[282938718,270337594,272566091],"refrenceIDs":[215721756,221613897,2249086,2379828,45622657,2454668,221995817,226507886,220319974],"pageRank":7.282551221803078E-4}
