{"id":228280215,"name":"Comparison between Standard and Adaptive MCMC via their diffusion limits","abstraction":"A good choice of the proposal distribution is crucial for the rapid convergence of the Metropolis algorithm. In this paper, given a family of parametric Markovian kernels, we develop an adaptive algorithm for finding the kernel that maximizes the expected squared jumped distance, an ob jective function that characterizes the Markov chain under its d-dimensional stationary distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in several examples.","authors":["Andrew Gelman","Cristian Pasarica"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51978901_Comparison_between_Standard_and_Adaptive_MCMC_via_their_diffusion_limits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228739696_Bayesian_Inference_for_Irreducible_Diffusion_Processes_Using_the_Pseudo-Marginal_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45916313_An_Adaptive_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Sampler"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245810545_Coupling_and_Ergodicity_of_Adaptive_MCMC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200111118_Markov_Chains_and_Stochastic_Stability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247011232_On_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Acceleration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326865_Optimal_Scaling_for_Various_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238291363_Optimally_combining_importance_sampling_techniques_for_Monte_Carlo_rendering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343668_Population_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2783885_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_through_Regeneration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2574717_Controlled_MCMC_for_optimal_sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4895745_Bayesian_Inference_in_Econometric_Models_Using_Monte_Carlo_Integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215755923_In_Numerical_Receipts_in_C_The_Art_of_Scientific_Computing"],"citedInIDs":[51978901,228739696,45916313],"refrenceIDs":[245810545,200111118,247011232,38326865,238291363,220343668,2783885,2574717,4895745,215755923],"pageRank":0.0010849143440734793}
