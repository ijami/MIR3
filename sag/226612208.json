{"id":226612208,"name":"Large Margin Classification with Indefinite Similarities","abstraction":"A fast Newton method, that suppresses input space features, is proposed for a linear programming formulation of support vector machine classifiers. The proposed stand-alone method can handle classification problems in very high dimensional spaces, such as 28,032 dimensions, and generates a classifier that depends on very few input features, such as 7 out of the original 28,032. The method can also handle problems with a large number of data points and requires no specialized linear programming packages but merely a linear equation solver. For nonlinear kernel classifiers, the method utilizes a minimal number of kernel functions in the classifier that it generates.","authors":["Glenn M. Fung","O.L.
