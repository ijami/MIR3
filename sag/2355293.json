{"id":2355293,"name":"Sub-geometric rates of convergence for Markov processes under subordination","abstraction":"Geometric convergence of Markov chains in discrete time on a general state has been studied in detail in [15]. Here we develop a similar theory for \u0027-irreducible continuous time processes, and consider the following types of criteria for geometric convergence: (a) the existence of exponentially bounded hitting times on one and then all suitably \"small\" sets; (b) the existence of \"Foster-Lyapunov\" or \"drift\" conditions for any one and then all skeleton and resolvent chains; (c) the existence of drift conditions on the extended generator e A of the process. We use the identity e AR fi \u003d fi(R fi Gamma I) connecting the extended generator and the resolvent kernels R fi , to show that, under a suitable aperiodicity assumption, exponential convergence is completely equivalent to any of (a)--(c). These conditions yield criteria for exponential convergence of unbounded as well as bounded functions of the chain. They enable us to identify the dependence of the convergence on the initial state ...","authors":["R. L.
