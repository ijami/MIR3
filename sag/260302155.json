{"id":260302155,"name":"Concentration in unbounded metric spaces and algorithmic stability","abstraction":"Recently, Kutin and Niyogi investigated several notions of algorithmic stability-a property of a learning map conceptually similar to continuity-showing that training stability is sufficient for consistency of empirical risk minimization (ERM) while distribution-free CV-stability is necessary and sufficient for having finite VC-dimension. This paper concerns a phase transition in the training stability of ERM, conjectured by the same authors. Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture.","authors":["Benjamin I. P.
