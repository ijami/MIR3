{"id":285598004,"name":"Unsupervised Topic Modeling in a Large Free Text Radiology Report Repository","abstraction":"Talent shortage is a well-known problem that industry has been dealing with for several years now, with a large number of engineering vacant positions being difficult to fill. We present an analysis of the Peruvian labor market demand based on data collected from job ads available on the web. We use topic models, a type of mixed-memberships models, in order to infer semantic categories in co-occurrence of words by focusing in the functions, requirements and professions requested in the job position. This information is extracted by applying shallow parsing over the ads before feeding them to the models. Models using the whole text from the ads are compared to models using only the text chunks extracted with shallow parsing. Our analysis reveal that using the extracted text chunks, some redundant categories are joined while others are splitted into more skill-specific categories. Fine-grained categories observed in models using the whole text are preserved.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228884043_On_smoothing_and_inference_for_topic_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2500185_An_Algorithm_that_Learns_What%27s_in_a_Name","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1768322_The_nested_Chinese_restaurant_process_and_Bayesian_inference_of_topic_hierarchies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618016_Correlated_Topic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345245_Dynamic_Topic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2572667_Cascaded_Grammatical_Relation_Assignment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220942860_Wide-Coverage_Spanish_Named_Entity_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2526069_Discriminative_Training_Methods_for_Hidden_Markov_Models_Theory_and_Experiments_with_Perceptron_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5329578_Mixed-membership_models_of_scientific_publications"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[228884043,2500185,1768322,221618016,221345245,262157385,2572667,220942860,2526069,5329578],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
