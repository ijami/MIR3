{"id":220226884,"name":"SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO METHODS FOR THE CALIBRATION OF STOCHASTIC RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS","abstraction":"This article considers the application of the unscented transformation to approximate fixed-interval optimal smoothing of continuous-time non-linear stochastic dynamic systems. The proposed methodology can be applied to systems, where the dynamics can be modeled with non-linear stochastic differential equations and the noise corrupted measurements are obtained continuously or at discrete times. The smoothing algorithm is based on computing the continuous-time limit of the recently proposed unscented Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother, which is an approximate optimal smoothing algorithm for discrete-time stochastic dynamic systems.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260347981_SEQUENTIAL_MONTE_CARLO_METHODS_FOR_THE_CALIBRATION_OF_STOCHASTIC_RAINFALL-RUNOFF_MODELS","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224068714_Dispersion-compensating_fiber_is_there_merit_in_the_figure_of_merit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49844161_A_data-driven_framework_for_neural_field_modeling"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721589_Stochastic_Models_Estimation_and_Control_Vol_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227621957_The_Unscented_Kalman_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222784162_Rao-Blackwellized_particle_filter_for_multiple_target_tracking_Inf_Fusion_J_82-15","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3028808_Optimal_filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36142880_Recursive_Bayesian_inference_on_stochastic_differential_equations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3033057_Unscented_Rauch--Tung--Striebel_Smoother","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230873432_Optimal_Control_And_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224334106_New_approach_to_filtering_for_nonlinear_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3114799_Estimation_Theory_with_Application_to_Communication_and_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3115576_Stochastic_Optimal_Linear_Estimation_and_Control"],"citedInIDs":[260347981,224068714,49844161],"refrenceIDs":[215721589,227621957,222784162,3028808,36142880,3033057,230873432,224334106,3114799,3115576],"pageRank":5.773000332215996E-4}
