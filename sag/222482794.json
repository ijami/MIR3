{"id":222482794,"name":"A comparison of performance of K-complex classification methods using feature selection","abstraction":"A supervised learning algorithm (Scaled Conjugate Gradient, SCG) is introduced. The performance of SCG is benchmarked against that of the standard back propagation algorithm (BP) (Rumelhart, Hinton, \u0026 Williams, 1986), the conjugate gradient algorithm with line search (CGL) (Johansson, Dowla, \u0026 Goodman, 1990) and the one-step Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno memoriless quasi-Newton algorithm (BFGS) (Battiti, 1990). SCG is fully-automated, includes no critical user-dependent parameters, and avoids a time consuming line search, which CGL and BFGS use in each iteration in order to determine an appropriate step size. Experiments show that SCG is considerably faster than BP, CGL, and BFGS.","authors":["Martin Fodslette MÃ¸ller"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281586671_A_comparison_of_performance_of_K-complex_classification_methods_using_feature_selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284243220_Neural_network_models_for_software_development_effort_estimation_a_comparative_study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282879825_Force_Estimation_and_Slip_Detection_for_Grip_Control_using_a_Biomimetic_Tactile_Sensor"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242380015_Practical_methoff_of_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300613_Practical_Methods_of_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227120838_Accelerating_the_convergence_of_the_back-propagation_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227201278_Restart_Procedures_for_the_Conjugate_Gradient_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222723168_Limitations_of_multi-layer_perceptron_networks_-_steps_towards_genetic_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227303359_Learning_by_conjugate_gradients","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225805834_Conjugate_Direction_Methods_of_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243243435_Farber_R_A_self-optimizing_nonsymmetrical_neural_net_for_content_addressable_memory_and_pattern_recognition_Physica_D_22_247-259","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242411110_Safeguarded_steplength_algorithms_for_optimization_using_descent_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267260197_Learning_Algorithms_for_Connectionist_Networks_Applied_Gradient_Methods_of_Nonlinear_Optimization"],"citedInIDs":[281586671,284243220,282879825],"refrenceIDs":[242380015,216300613,227120838,227201278,222723168,227303359,225805834,243243435,242411110,267260197],"pageRank":8.96726907614175E-4}
