{"id":268291396,"name":"Qualitative Multi-Armed Bandits: A Quantile-Based Approach","abstraction":"We consider the problem of selecting, from among the arms of a stochastic n-armed bandit, a subset of size m of those arms with the highest expected rewards, based on efficiently sampling the arms. This \"sub-set selection\" problem finds application in a variety of areas. In the authors\u0027 previ-ous work (Kalyanakrishnan \u0026 Stone, 2010), this problem is framed under a PAC setting (denoted \"Explore-m\"), and corresponding sampling algorithms are analyzed. Whereas the formal analysis therein is restricted to the worst case sample complexity of algo-rithms, in this paper, we design and ana-lyze an algorithm (\"LUCB\") with improved expected sample complexity. Interestingly LUCB bears a close resemblance to the well-known UCB algorithm for regret minimiza-tion. The expected sample complexity bound we show for LUCB is novel even for single-arm selection (Explore-1). We also give a lower bound on the worst case sample com-plexity of PAC algorithms for Explore-m.","authors":["Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277924329_Qualitative_Multi-Armed_Bandits_A_Quantile-Based_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263545276_Unimodal_Bandits_without_Smoothness","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234061312_Best_Arm_Identification_A_Unified_Approach_to_Fixed_Budget_and_Fixed_Confidence"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320322_Action_Elimination_and_Stopping_Conditions_for_the_Multi-Armed_Bandit_and_Reinforcement_Learning_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497549_Best_Arm_Identification_in_Multi-Armed_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2942622_The_Sample_Complexity_of_Exploration_in_the_Multi-Armed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2788600_Sequential_PAC_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344896_Efficient_Selection_of_Multiple_Bandit_Arms_Theory_and_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346082_Empirical_Bernstein_stopping"],"citedInIDs":[277924329,263545276,234061312],"refrenceIDs":[220320322,221497549,2942622,2788600,221344896,220343796,221346082],"pageRank":6.084591538544757E-4}
