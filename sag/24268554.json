{"id":24268554,"name":"Approximations of Markov Chains and High-Dimensional Bayesian Inference","abstraction":"We provide explicit non-asymptotic estimates for the rate of convergence of empirical means of Markov chains, together with a Gaussian or exponential control on the deviations of empirical means. These estimates hold under a â€œpositive curvature â€? assumption expressing a kind of metric ergodicity, which generalizes the Ricci curvature from differential geometry and, on finite graphs, amounts to contraction under path coupling. The goal of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method is to provide an efficient way to approximate the integral Ï€(f): \u003d âˆ« f(x)Ï€(dx) of a function f under a finite measure Ï€ on some space X. This approach, which has been very successful, consists in constructing a hopefully easy-to-simulate Markov chain (X1, X2,...,Xk,...) on X with stationary distribution Ï€, waiting for a time T0 (the burn-in) so that the chain gets close to its stationary distribution, and then estimating Ï€(f) by the empirical mean on the next T steps of the trajectory, with T large enough:","authors":["AldÃ©ric Joulin","Yann Ollivier"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281058916_Approximations_of_Markov_Chains_and_High-Dimensional_Bayesian_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267046408_Convergence_rate_and_concentration_inequalities_for_Gibbs_sampling_in_high_dimension","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069419_Finite_Sample_Properties_of_Adaptive_Markov_Chains_via_Curvature"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239230352_Topics_in_Optimal_Transportation_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200111118_Markov_Chains_and_Stochastic_Stability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268670080_Markov_chains_and_mixing_times_With_a_chapter_on_Coupling_from_the_past_by_James_G_Propp_and_David_B_Wilson","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2111878_General_state_space_Markov_chains_and_MCMC_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41222714_Deviation_bounds_for_additive_functionals_of_Markov_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245653475_Cherno-type_bound_for_nite_Markov_chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2115335_Transportation_cost-information_inequalities_and_applications_to_random_dynamical_systems_and_diffusions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1896396_Transportation-information_inequalities_for_Markov_processes_II_Relations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1763332_Poisson-type_deviation_inequalities_for_curved_continuous-time_Markov_chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247384599_Relaxation_Times_of_Markov_Chains_in_Statistical_Mechanics_and_Combinatorial_Structures"],"citedInIDs":[281058916,267046408,257069419],"refrenceIDs":[239230352,200111118,268670080,2111878,41222714,245653475,2115335,1896396,1763332,247384599],"pageRank":5.989502996454975E-4}
