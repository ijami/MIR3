{"id":1771219,"name":"A Survey of Stochastic Simulation and Optimization Methods in Signal Processing","abstraction":"In this paper, we shall optimize the efficiency of Metropolis algorithms for multidimensional target distributions with scaling terms possibly depending on the dimension. We propose a method for determining the appropriate form for the scaling of the proposal distribution as a function of the dimension, which leads to the proof of an asymptotic diffusion theorem. We show that when there does not exist any component with a scaling term significantly smaller than the others, the asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is the well-known 0.234.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275897326_A_Survey_of_Stochastic_Simulation_and_Optimization_Methods_in_Signal_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245025933_On_Optimal_Scaling_of_Additive_Transformation_Based_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233967527_Optimal_scaling_for_the_transient_phase_of_Metropolis_Hastings_algorithms_The_longtime_behavior"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363050_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems_Comment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235726242_A_First_Look_at_Rigorous_Probability_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326865_Optimal_Scaling_for_Various_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4771819_Probability_and_Random_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2111878_General_state_space_Markov_chains_and_MCMC_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227672958_Optimal_scaling_of_discrete_approximations_to_Langevin_diffusions_J_R_Stat_Soc_Ser_B_Stat_Methodol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2113732_Optimal_Scaling_of_Mala_for_Nonlinear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2834582_Scaling_Limits_for_the_Transient_Phase_of_Local_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236157562_Markov_Processes_Characterization_and_Convergence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31403274_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_Using_Markov_Chains_and_Their_Application"],"citedInIDs":[275897326,245025933,233967527],"refrenceIDs":[38363050,235726242,38326865,4771819,2111878,227672958,2113732,2834582,236157562,31403274],"pageRank":9.047284032881962E-4}
