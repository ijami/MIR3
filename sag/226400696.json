{"id":226400696,"name":"Maximum Entropy Evaluation of Asymptotic Hedging Error under a Generalised Jump-Diffusion Model","abstraction":"Some general formulae are obtained for size-biased sampling from a Poisson point process in an abstract space where the size of a point is defined by an arbitrary strictly positive function. These formulae explain why in certain cases (gamma and stable) the size-biased permutation of the normalized jumps of a subordinator can be represented by a stickbreaking (residual allocation) scheme defined by independent beta random variables. An application is made to length biased sampling of excursions of a Markov process away from a recurrent point of its statespace, with emphasis on the Brownian and Bessel cases when the associated inverse local time is a stable subordinator. Results in this case are linked to generalizations of the arcsine law for the fraction of time spent positive by Brownian motion.","authors":["Jim Pitman"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282337673_Maximum_Entropy_Evaluation_of_Asymptotic_Hedging_Error_under_a_Generalised_Jump-Diffusion_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282181400_Generalized_Mittag_Leffler_distributions_arising_as_limits_in_preferential_attachment_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275054884_Limits_of_renewal_processes_and_Pitman-Yor_distribution"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243100330_Limit_Measures_Arising_in_the_Asymptotic_Theory_of_Symmetric_Groups_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245481078_Arcsine_Laws_and_Interval_Partitions_Derived_from_a_Stable_Subordinator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243771125_A_Model_for_the_Distribution_of_Individuals_by_Species_in_an_Environment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361825_Splitting_at_Backward_Times_in_Regenerative_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362000_Zeros_of_the_Densities_of_Infinitely_Divisible_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227883469_Brownian_Bridge_Asymptotics_for_Random_p-Mappings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245962958_Diversity_as_a_Concept_and_its_Implications_for_Random_Communities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38345595_Ordered_cycle_lengths_in_a_random_permutation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223166385_Continuity_and_weak_convergence_of_ranked_and_size-biased_permutations_on_the_infinite_simplex","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766501_Population_Genetics_Theory_-_The_Past_and_the_Future"],"citedInIDs":[282337673,282181400,275054884],"refrenceIDs":[243100330,245481078,243771125,38361825,38362000,227883469,245962958,38345595,223166385,243766501],"pageRank":9.799751181802413E-4}
