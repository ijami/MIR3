{"id":267947119,"name":"Latent Gaussian Processes for Distribution Estimation of Multivariate Categorical Data","abstraction":"The development of accurate models and effi-cient algorithms for the analysis of multivari-ate categorical data are important and long-standing problems in machine learning and computational statistics. In this paper, we focus on modeling categorical data using La-tent Gaussian Models (LGMs). We propose a novel stick-breaking likelihood function for categorical LGMs that exploits accurate lin-ear and quadratic bounds on the logistic log-partition function, leading to an effective variational inference and learning framework. We thoroughly compare our approach to ex-isting algorithms for multinomial logit/probit likelihoods on several problems, including in-ference in multinomial Gaussian process clas-sification and learning in latent factor mod-els. Our extensive comparisons demonstrate that our stick-breaking model effectively cap-tures correlation in discrete data and is well suited for the analysis of categorical data.","authors":["Shakir Mohamed","Benjamin M Marlin","Kevin P Murphy"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388187_Latent_Gaussian_Processes_for_Distribution_Estimation_of_Multivariate_Categorical_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266502061_Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278670630_Can_Zakat_System_Alleviate_Rural_Poverty_in_Bangladesh_a_propensity_score_matching_approach"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[273388187,266502061,278670630],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":5.773000332215996E-4}
