{"id":8195073,"name":"Bayesian Segmental Models with Multiple Sequence Alignment Profiles for Protein Secondary Structure and Contact Map Prediction","abstraction":"A new general algorithm for optimization of potential functions for protein folding is introduced. It is based upon gradient optimization of the thermodynamic stability of native folds of a training set of proteins with known structure. The iterative update rule contains two thermodynamic averages which are estimated by (generalized ensemble) Monte Carlo. We test the learning algorithm on a Lennard-Jones (LJ) force field with a torsional angle degrees-of-freedom and a single-atom side-chain. In a test with 24 peptides of known structure, none folded correctly with the initial potential functions, but two-thirds came within 3 A to their native fold after optimizing the potential functions.","authors":["Anders Krogh"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6748124_Bayesian_Segmental_Models_with_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Profiles_for_Protein_Secondary_Structure_and_Contact_Map_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242295337_Advances_in_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6689211_Learning_about_protein_hydrogen_bonding_by_minimizing_contrastive_divergence"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21560325_Optimal_Protein-Folding_Codes_from_Spin-Glass_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13750392_An_All-atom_Distance-dependent_Conditional_Probability_Discriminatory_Function_for_Protein_Structure_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13730883_Interaction_potentials_for_protein_folding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12231620_Three-helix-bundle_protein_in_a_Ramachandran_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19041815_Principles_that_Govern_the_Folding_of_Protein_Chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21752107_Contact_potential_recognizes_the_correct_folding_of_globular_proteins","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11524382_Rosetta_in_CASP4_progress_in_ab_initio_protein_structure_prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14556080_How_optimization_of_potential_function_affects_protein_folding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12556689_A_statistical_mechanical_method_to_optimize_energy_functions_for_protein_folding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14596698_Residue-Residue_Potentials_with_a_Favorable_Contact_Pair_Term_and_an_Unfavorable_High_Packing_Density_Term_for_Simulation_and_Threading"],"citedInIDs":[6748124,242295337,6689211],"refrenceIDs":[21560325,13750392,13730883,12231620,19041815,21752107,11524382,14556080,12556689,14596698],"pageRank":6.180156680213055E-4}
