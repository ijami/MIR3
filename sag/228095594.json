{"id":228095594,"name":"Leveraging temporal properties of news events for stock market prediction","abstraction":"We investigate the problem of modeling symbolic sequences of polyphonic music in a completely general piano-roll representation. We introduce a probabilistic model based on distribution estimators conditioned on a recurrent neural network that is able to discover temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences. Our approach outperforms many traditional models of polyphonic music on a variety of realistic datasets. We show how our musical language model can serve as a symbolic prior to improve the accuracy of polyphonic transcription.","authors":["Pascal Vincent"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284554342_Leveraging_temporal_properties_of_news_events_for_stock_market_prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476202_Recurrent_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282665965_Efficient_movement_representation_by_embedding_Dynamic_Movement_Primitives_in_Deep_Autoencoders"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5583935_Learning_Long-Term_Dependencies_with_Gradient_Descent_Is_Difficult","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2400598_Modeling_High-Dimensional_Discrete_Data_with_Multi-Layer_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618351_Harmonising_Chorales_by_Probabilistic_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220723631_Evaluation_of_Multiple-F0_Estimation_and_Tracking_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41386954_Probabilistic_Models_for_Melodic_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619549_The_Recurrent_Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239571798_Smolensky_P_Information_processing_in_dynamical_systems_Foundations_of_harmony_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319842_The_Neural_Autoregressive_Distribution_Estimator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228370618_A_hierarchy_of_recurrent_networks_for_speech_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344668_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Hessian-Free_Optimization"],"citedInIDs":[284554342,284476202,282665965],"refrenceIDs":[5583935,2400598,221618351,220723631,41386954,221619549,239571798,220319842,228370618,221344668],"pageRank":5.787435674664022E-4}
