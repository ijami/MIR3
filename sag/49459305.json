{"id":49459305,"name":"Limiting Spectral Distribution of a Symmetrized Auto-Cross Covariance Matrix","abstraction":"A major problem for kernel-based predictors (such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian processes) is that the amount of computation required to find the solution scales as O(n ), where n is the number of training examples. We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can be computed by the Nystr?m method (which is used for the numerical solution of eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller system of size m \u003c n, and then...","authors":["T. Leen","T.
