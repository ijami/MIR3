{"id":287209198,"name":"Kullback-Leibler Distance Methods for Detecting Disease Association with Rare Variants from Sequencing Data: Kullback-Leibler Distance-Based Tests","abstraction":"We propose a new variational inference method based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) proximal term. We make two contributions towards improving efficiency of variational inference. Firstly, we derive a KL proximal-point algorithm and show its equivalence to gradient descent with natural gradient in stochastic variational inference. Secondly, we use the proximal framework to derive efficient variational algorithms for non-conjugate models. We propose a splitting procedure to separate non-conjugate terms from conjugate ones. We then linearize the non-conjugate terms and show that the resulting subproblem admits a closed-form solution. Overall, our approach converts a non-conjugate model to subproblems that involve inference in well-known conjugate models. We apply our method to many models and derive generalizations for non-conjugate exponential family. Applications to real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms are easy to implement, fast to converge, perform well, and reduce computations.","authors":["Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan","Francois Fleuret"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092206_Stochastic_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228083473_Fixed-Form_Variational_Posterior_Approximation_through_Stochastic_Linear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259528495_Black_Box_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744767_Online_Model_Selection_Based_on_the_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320926_Approximate_Riemannian_Conjugate_Gradient_Learning_for_Fixed-Form_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080172_Kullback_proximal_algorithms_for_maximum-likelihood_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220442791_An_Analysis_of_the_EM_Algorithm_and_Entropy-Like_Proximal_Point_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246554763_Convergence_of_Proximal-Like_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346060_Message-passing_for_graph-structured_linear_programs_Proximal_projections_convergence_and_rounding_schemes_Technical_Report","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279808509_D-MFVI_Distributed_Mean_Field_Variational_Inference_using_Bregman_ADMM"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[228092206,228083473,259528495,200744767,220320926,3080172,220442791,246554763,221346060,279808509],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
