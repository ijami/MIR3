{"id":243615858,"name":"Neurite tracing with object process","abstraction":"We survey the use of Markov models from stochastic geometry as priors in ‘high-level’ computer vision, in direct analogy with the use of discrete Markov random fields in ‘low-level’ vision. There are analogues of the Gibbs sampler, ICM and simulated annealing, and connections with existing methods in computer vision.","authors":["A. J. Baddeley","M. N. M.
