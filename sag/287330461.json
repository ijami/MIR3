{"id":287330461,"name":"Enhanced Version of Multi-algorithm Genetically Adaptive for Multiobjective optimization","abstraction":"Multi-objective optimization has become mainstream for solving several real-world problems which are naturally posed as Multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) in all fields of engineering and science. Usually, MOPs consist of more than two conflicting objective functions which demand trade-off solutions. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are extremely useful and well-suited for solving MOPs due to their population based nature. MOEAs evolve its population of solutions in a natural way and search for approximate solutions in single simulation run unlike traditional methods. These algorithms make use of various intrinsic search operators in an efficient manner. In this paper, we experimentally study the impact of multiple crossovers in multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) framework and evaluate its performance over test instances of 2009 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation (CEC’09) developed for MOEAs competition. Based on our experiments, we observe that variation operators are the main source to improve the algorithmic performance of MOEA/D for dealing with CEC’09 complicated test problems.","authors":["Rasheeda Adeeb Khanum"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288838659_Enhanced_Version_of_Multi-algorithm_Genetically_Adaptive_for_Multiobjective_optimization"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4201447_A_population-based_steady-state_procedure_for_real-parameter_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260622144_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Algorithms_in_Aeronautical_and_Aerospace_Engineering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45280500_HypE_An_Algorithm_for_Fast_Hypervolume-Based_Many-Objective_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222030993_SMS-EMOA_multiobjective_selection_based_on_dominated_hypervolume_Eur_J_Oper_Res","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3418912_A_Multiobjective_Optimization-Based_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Constrained_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300453_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Solving_Multi-Objective_Problems_SE_-_Genetic_and_Evolutionary_Computation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300483_Multiobjective_Optimization_Principles_and_Case_Studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2460803_Normal-Boundary_Intersection_A_New_Method_for_Generating_the_Pareto_Surface_in_Nonlinear_Multicriteria_Optimization_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3949503_Scalable_multi-objective_optimization_test_problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266476598_Multi-Objective_Optimization_Using_Evolutionary_Algorithms_Wiley_New_York"],"citedInIDs":[288838659],"refrenceIDs":[4201447,260622144,45280500,222030993,3418912,216300453,216300483,2460803,3949503,266476598],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
