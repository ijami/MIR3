{"id":260669733,"name":"Nonparametric finite translation hidden Markov models and extensions","abstraction":"Multiple instance learning is a recently researched learning paradigm in machine intelligence which operates under conditions of uncertainty. A Multiple Instance Hidden Markov Model (MI-HMM) is investigated with applications to landmine detection using ground penetrating radar data. Without introducing any additional parameters, the MI-HMM provides an elegant and simple way to learn the parameters of an HMM in a multiple instance framework. The efficacy of the model is shown on a real landmine dataset. Experiments on the landmine dataset show that MI-HMM learning is effective.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220695762_InformationTheory_Inference_and_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333516_Minimum_Classification_Error_Rate_Methods_for_Speech_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224206916_Land-Mine_Detection_With_Ground-Penetrating_Radar_Using_Multistream_Discrete_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224227685_Simultaneous_feature_and_HMM_Model_learning_for_landmine_detection_using_Ground_Penetrating_Radar","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3203627_Detecting_landmines_with_ground-penetrating_radar_using_feature-based_rules_order_statistics_and_adaptive_whitening","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26531839_Real-Time_Landmine_Detection_with_Ground-Penetrating_Radar_Using_Discriminative_and_Adaptive_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223845565_Random_set_framework_for_multiple_instance_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3318307_An_MCMC_sampling_approach_to_estimation_of_nonstationary_hidden_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242549520_Solving_the_multiple-instance_problem_with_axisparallel_rectangles","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3202631_Landmine_detection_with_ground_penetrating_radar_using_hidden_Markov_models"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[220695762,3333516,224206916,224227685,3203627,26531839,223845565,3318307,242549520,3202631],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
