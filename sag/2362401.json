{"id":2362401,"name":"Good edit similarity learning by loss minimization","abstraction":"We define notions of stability for learning algorithms and show how to use these notions to derive generalization error bounds based on the empirical error and the leave-one-out error. The methods we use can be applied in the regression framework as well as in the classification one when the classifier is obtained by thresholding a real-valued function. We study the stability properties of large classes of learning algorithms such as regularization based algorithms. In particular we focus on Hilbert space regularization and Kullback-Leibler regularization. We demonstrate how to apply the results to SVM for regression and classification.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236596301_Good_edit_similarity_learning_by_loss_minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24013767_Domain_Adaptation_Learning_Bounds_and_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620582_Y_Regularized_Distance_Metric_Learning_Theory_and_Algorithm"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3593599_Scale-sensitive_dimensions_uniform_convergence_and_learnability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279908376_For_Valid_Generalization_the_Size_of_the_Weights_is_More_Important_Than_the_Size_of_the_Network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265359068_Optimization_Problems_with_Perturbations_A_Guided_Tour","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620643_Algorithmic_Stability_and_Generalization_Performance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348679_Heuristics_of_Instability_and_Stabilization_in_Model_Selection_The_Annals_of_Statistics_246_2350-2383","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261662232_Elements_of_Information_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239223063_Exponential_Inequalities_in_Nonparametric_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230675276_A_Probablistic_Theory_of_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3083185_Distribution-free_inequalities_for_the_deleted_and_holdout_error_estimates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3083261_Distribution-Free_Performance_Bounds_for_Potential_Function_Rules"],"citedInIDs":[236596301,24013767,221620582],"refrenceIDs":[3593599,279908376,265359068,221620643,38348679,261662232,239223063,230675276,3083185,3083261],"pageRank":6.073188886173057E-4}
