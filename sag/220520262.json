{"id":220520262,"name":"A new algorithm for extracting a small representative subgraph from a very large graph","abstraction":"In a time of information glut, observations about complex systems and phenomena of interest are available in several applications areas, such as biology and text. As a conse- quence, scientists have started searching for patterns that involve interactions among the objects of analysis, to the effect that research on models and algorithms for network analysis has become a central theme for knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD). The intuitions behind the plethora of approaches rely upon few basic types of networks, identi- fied by specific local and global topological properties, which we term \"pure\" topology types. In this paper, (1) we survey pure topology types along with existing sampling algorithms that generate them, (2) we in- troduce novel algorithms that enhance the diversity of sam- ples, and address the case of cellular topologies, (3) we per- form statistical studies of the stability of the properties of pure types to alternative generative algorithms, and a joint study of the separability of pure types, in terms of their em- bedding in a space of metrics for network analysis, widely adopted in the social and physical sciences. We conclude with a word of caution to the practitioners, who sample pure topology types to assess the \"statistical signifi- cance\" of their findings, e.g., the p-value of the clustering co- efficient is sensitive to the sampling algorithm used. We find that different pure types share similar topological properties. Further, real world networks hardly present the variability profile of a single pure type. We suggest the assumption of \"mixtures of types\" as an alternative starting point for developing models and algorithms for network analysis.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229430161_A_new_algorithm_for_extracting_a_small_representative_subgraph_from_avery_large_graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257015597_Network_sampling_and_classification_An_investigation_of_network_model_representations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47555572_Information_propagation_within_the_Genetic_Network_of_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220520197_Graph-based_relational_learning_current_and_future_directions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240160210_ORA_Organizational_Risk_Analyzer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222700230_Models_of_CorePeriphery_Structures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241140471_Relating_Network_Topology_to_the_Robustness_of_Centrality_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222450567_An_Algorithm_for_Clustering_Relational_Data_with_Applications_to_Social_Network_Analysis_and_Comparison_with_Multidimensional_Scaling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2361119_The_Origins_of_the_Deadline_Optimizing_Communication_in_Organizations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3085486_Impact_of_Antenna_Correlation_on_the_Capacity_of_Multiantenna_Channels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220812979_Probabilistic_Classification_and_Clustering_in_Relational_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37991959_Discovering_Latent_Classes_in_Relational_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245582256_Bayesian_Methods_for_Frequent_Terms_in_Text_Models_of_Contagion_and_the_2_Statistic"],"citedInIDs":[229430161,257015597,47555572],"refrenceIDs":[220520197,240160210,222700230,241140471,222450567,2361119,3085486,220812979,37991959,245582256],"pageRank":7.565446699929518E-4}
