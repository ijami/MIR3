{"id":288713780,"name":"On-line Bayesian System Identification","abstraction":"Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods are Bayesian analogs to popular stochastic optimization methods; however, this connection is not well studied. We explore this relationship by applying simulated annealing to an SGMCMC algorithm. Furthermore, we extend recent SG-MCMC methods with two key components: i) adaptive preconditioners (as in ADAgrad or RMSprop), and ii) adaptive element-wise momentum weights. The zero-temperature limit gives a novel stochastic optimization method with adaptive element-wise momentum weights, while conventional optimization methods only have a shared, static momentum weight. Under certain assumptions, our theoretical analysis suggests the proposed simulated annealing approach converges close to the global optima. Experiments on several deep neural network models show state-of-the-art results compared to related stochastic optimization algorithms.","authors":["Changyou Chen","Chunyuan Li","Lawrence Carin"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140081_Reversible_Jump_MCMC_Simulated_Annealing_for_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228671354_Large-scale_machine_learning_with_stochastic_gradient_descent_In_COMPSTAT","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095594_Modeling_Temporal_Dependencies_in_High-Dimensional_SequencesApplication_to_Polyphonic_Music_Generation_and_Transcription","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260232379_Stochastic_Gradient_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262877889_Learning_Phrase_Representations_using_RNN_Encoder-Decoder_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272423025_RMSProp_and_equilibrated_adaptive_learning_rates_for_non-convex_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269692923_Bayesian_Sampling_Using_Stochastic_Gradient_Thermostats","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320677_Adaptive_Subgradient_Methods_for_Online_Learning_and_Stochastic_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278244488_Scalable_Deep_Poisson_Factor_Analysis_for_Topic_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239582331_Stochastic_Relaxation_Gibbs_Distributions_and_the_Bayesian_Resoration_of_Images"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[234140081,228671354,228095594,260232379,262877889,272423025,269692923,220320677,278244488,239582331],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
