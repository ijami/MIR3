{"id":220873199,"name":"Inducing Compact but Accurate Tree-Substitution Grammars.","abstraction":"Historically, unsupervised learning tech- niques have lacked a principled technique for selecting the number of unseen compo- nents. Research into non-parametric priors, such as the Dirichlet process, has enabled in- stead the use of infinite models, in which the number of hidden categories is not fixed, but can grow with the amount of training data. Here we develop the infinite tree, a new infi- nite model capable of representing recursive branching structure over an arbitrarily large set of hidden categories. Specifically, we develop three infinite tree models, each of which enforces different independence as- sumptions, and for each model we define a simple direct assignmentsampling inference procedure. We demonstrate the utility of our models by doing unsupervised learning of part-of-speech tags from treebank depen- dency skeleton structure, achieving an accu- racy of 75.34%, and by doing unsupervised splitting of part-of-speech tags, which in- creases the accuracy of a generative depen- dency parser from 85.11% to 87.35%.","authors":["Jenny Rose Finkel","Trond Grenager"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816839_Inducing_Compact_but_Accurate_Tree-Substitution_Grammars","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874077_A_Note_on_the_Implementation_of_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816882_Shared_Logistic_Normal_Distributions_for_Soft_Parameter_Tying_in_Unsupervised_Grammar_Induction"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2921800_In_Accurate_Unlexicalized_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248351900_TreeBank_Grammars","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2861972_Factored_A_Search_for_Models_over_Sequences_and_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873863_Learning_Accurate_Compact_and_Interpretable_Tree_Annotation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816756_Prototype-Driven_Learning_for_Sequence_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873283_Contrastive_Estimation_Training_Log-Linear_Models_on_Unlabeled_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243774058_Scalable_clustering_methods_for_data_mining","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2364663_Poisson-Dirichlet_and_GEM_Invariant_Distributions_for_Split-and-Merge_Transformations_of_an_Interval_Partition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220355517_Head-Driven_Statistical_Models_for_Natural_Language_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes"],"citedInIDs":[220816839,220874077,220816882],"refrenceIDs":[2921800,248351900,2861972,220873863,220816756,220873283,243774058,2364663,220355517,32896369],"pageRank":6.15143940685441E-4}
