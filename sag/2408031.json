{"id":2408031,"name":"Novel Scheme of Orthogonal Convolutional Coding and Non-iterative Decoding for Mobile Satellite Communication Systems","abstraction":"Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable alternative for constructing high performance coding systems. In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \"Tanner graph\". With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278499871_Novel_Scheme_of_Orthogonal_Convolutional_Coding_and_Non-iterative_Decoding_for_Mobile_Satellite_Communication_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275836259_Frequency-Asynchronous_Multiuser_Joint_Channel-Parameter_Estimation_CFO_Compensation_and_Channel_Decoding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268470191_Implementation_of_a_Multi-User_Detector_for_Satellite_Return_Links_on_a_GPU_Platform"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3660985_On_trellis_complexity_of_block_codes_optimal_sectionalizations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3661005_On_trellis_complexity_of_block_codes_lower_bounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224671439_Decoding_Turbo-Codes_with_the_Soft_Output_Viterbi_Algorithm_SOVA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3602224_Densitylength_profiles_and_trellis_complexity_of_linear_blockcodes_and_lattices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3604275_Near_Shannon_Limit_Error-Correcting_Coding_and_Decoding_Turbo_Codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227705372_Codes_and_Iterative_Decoding_on_General_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220695898_Combinatorial_Optimization_Algorithms_and_Complexity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239195390_Low-Density_Parity-Check_Codes_for_the_Gilbert-Elliott_Channel","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3078954_Unveiling_turbo_codes_Some_results_on_parallel_concatenated_coding_schemes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2522539_Interleaving_Strategies_for_Product_Codes"],"citedInIDs":[278499871,275836259,268470191],"refrenceIDs":[3660985,3661005,224671439,3602224,3604275,227705372,220695898,239195390,3078954,2522539],"pageRank":0.0011911947160559108}
