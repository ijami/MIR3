{"id":3080728,"name":"Learning without Concentration for General Loss Functions","abstraction":"We study the sample complexity of proper and improper learning problems with respect to different q-loss functions. We improve the known estimates for classes which have relatively small covering numbers in empirical L2 spaces (e.g. log-covering numbers which are polynomial with exponent p\u003c2). We present several examples of relevant classes which have a \"small\" fat-shattering dimension, and hence fit our setup, the most important of which are kernel machines","authors":["S.
