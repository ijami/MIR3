{"id":222883365,"name":"Bayesian Learning in Undirected Graphical Models: Approximate MCMC algorithms","abstraction":"Markov random field (MRF) modelling is a popular method for pattern recognition and computer vision and MRF parameter estimation is of particular importance to MRF modelling. In this paper, a new approach based on Metropolis–Hastings algorithm and gradient method is presented to estimate MRF parameters. With properly chosen proposal distribution for Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, the Markov chain constructed by the method converges to stationary distribution quickly and it gives a good estimation result.","authors":["Yihua Yu","Qiansheng Cheng"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157569_Bayesian_Learning_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models_Approximate_MCMCalgorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40763755_High_resolution_SAR-image_classification_by_Markov_random_fields_and_finite_mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3204200_A_Model-Based_Approach_to_Multiresolution_Fusion_in_Remotely_Sensed_Images"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224185239_Unsupervised_segmentation_of_multisensor_images_using_generalized_hidden_Markov_chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224377996_Modeling_and_Segmentation_of_Noisy_and_Textured_Images_Using_Gibbs_Random_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282444750_Image_Analysis_Random_Fields_and_Dynamic_Monte_Carlo_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221669734_Equations_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220599969_MRF_parameter_estimation_by_MCMC_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266452842_Image_Analysis_Random_Fields_and_Dynamic_Monte_Carlo_Methods_A_Mathematical_Introduction_Springer-Verlag_Berlin","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224839692_Spatial_Interaction_and_the_Statistical_Analysis_of_Lattice_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215446267_Monte_Carlo_Strategies_in_Scientic_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200622065_Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741"],"citedInIDs":[229157569,40763755,3204200],"refrenceIDs":[224185239,224377996,282444750,221669734,220599969,266452842,224839692,215446267,200622065,220182914],"pageRank":6.180156680213055E-4}
