{"id":24052099,"name":"Classification of Hyperspectral Images by Exploiting Spectral–Spatial Information of Superpixel via Multiple Kernels","abstraction":"The lower bound principle (introduced in Böhning and Lindsay 1988, Ann. Inst. Statist. Math., 40, 641–663), Böhning (1989, Biometrika, 76, 375–383) consists of replacing the second derivative matrix by a global lower bound in the Loewner ordering. This bound is used in the Newton-Raphson iteration instead of the Hessian matrix leading to a monotonically converging sequence of iterates. Here, we apply this principle to the multinomial logistic regression model, where it becomes specifically attractive.","authors":["Dankmar Böhning"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281607885_Classification_of_Hyperspectral_Images_by_Exploiting_Spectral-Spatial_Information_of_Superpixel_via_Multiple_Kernels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283337113_GeoSRS_A_hybrid_social_recommender_system_for_geolocated_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280695940_Multimodal_Factor_Analysis"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30998548_Likelihood_inference_for_mixtures_Geometrical_and_other_constructions_of_monotone_step-length_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242464260_A_note_on_the_matrix_ordering_of_special_c-matrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24051918_Monotonicity_of_quadratic_approximation_algorithms_Ann_Inst_Stat_Math"],"citedInIDs":[281607885,283337113,280695940],"refrenceIDs":[30998548,242464260,24051918],"pageRank":8.077233723398878E-4}
