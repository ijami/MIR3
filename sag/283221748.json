{"id":283221748,"name":"Social Factors and Healthy Aging: Findings from the Louisiana Healthy Aging Study (LHAS)","abstraction":"This paper describes a novel method for generating and integrating knowledge graphs extracted from multiple natural language sources by FRED, a machine reading tool for generating abstract representations of text documents. This is a key problem in human-robot spoken dialogue interaction, issue which arises from a current research project related to active and healthy ageing using caring service robots where we are involved. The problem is also relevant in many application scenarios requiring the creation and dynamic evolution of a knowledge base, such as automatic news summarisation. Solving this problem requires solving sub-tasks that have only been studied individually, so far. We propose a holistic approach to handle FRED\u0027s graphs related to different input texts and output a knowledge graph representing the reconciled knowledge.","authors":["Misael Mongiov√¨","Aldo Gangemi"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270878006_Robust_Entity_Clustering_via_Phylogenetic_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013298_Resolving_Event_Noun_Phrases_to_Their_Verbal_Mentions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24017968_A_new_graph-based_method_for_pairwise_global_network_alignment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220814612_Improve_Tree_Kernel-Based_Event_Pronoun_Resolution_with_Competitive_Information","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229329057_SiGMa_Simple_Greedy_Matching_for_Aligning_Large_Knowledge_Bases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262166615_Joint_Entity_and_Event_Coreference_Resolution_across_Documents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264412715_Cross-Document_Coreference_Resolution_using_Latent_Features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221102393_Streaming_Cross_Document_Entity_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257777535_SEMILAR_The_Semantic_Similarity_Toolkit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874817_Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[270878006,221013298,24017968,220814612,229329057,262166615,264412715,221102393,257777535,220874817],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
