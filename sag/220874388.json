{"id":220874388,"name":"Controlling Complexity in Part-of-Speech Induction","abstraction":"Unsupervised learning of linguistic structure is a difficult problem. A common approach is to define a generative model and max- imize the probability of the hidden struc- ture given the observed data. Typically, this is done using maximum-likelihood es- timation (MLE) of the model parameters. We show using part-of-speech tagging that a fully Bayesian approach can greatly im- prove performance. Rather than estimating a single set of parameters, the Bayesian ap- proach integrates over all possible parame- ter values. This difference ensures that the learned structure will have high probability over a range of possible parameters, and per- mits the use of priors favoring the sparse distributions that are typical of natural lan- guage. Our model has the structure of a standard trigram HMM, yet its accuracy is closer to that of a state-of-the-art discrimi- native model (Smith and Eisner, 2005), up to 14 percentage points better than MLE. We find improvements both when training from data alone, and using a tagging dictionary.","authors":["Sharon Goldwater","Tom Griffiths"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259875389_Controlling_Complexity_in_Part-of-Speech_Induction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260669733_Multiple_Instance_Learning_for_Hidden_Markov_Models_Application_to_Landmine_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262347122_Mixed_membership_Markov_models_for_unsupervised_conversation_modeling"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2353758_Inducing_Syntactic_Categories_by_Context_Distribution_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220355244_Class-Based_n-gram_Models_of_Natural_Language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816756_Prototype-Driven_Learning_for_Sequence_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766998_Ac-quiring_syntactic_information_from_distributional_statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2859445_A_Generative_Constituent-Context_Model_for_Improved_Grammar_Induction_Dan_Klein_and_Christopher_D_Manning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873283_Contrastive_Estimation_Training_Log-Linear_Models_on_Unlabeled_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4225015_Improved_estimation_for_unsupervised_part-of-speech_tagging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817030_Bayesian_Inference_for_PCFGs_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo"],"citedInIDs":[259875389,260669733,262347122],"refrenceIDs":[2353758,220355244,220816756,243766998,2859445,220182914,220873283,4225015,220817030],"pageRank":8.426955409554632E-4}
