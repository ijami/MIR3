{"id":220873283,"name":"Model Selection for Type-Supervised Learning with Application to POS Tagging","abstraction":"Conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are quite effective at sequence labeling tasks like shal- low parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and named- entity extraction (McCallum and Li, 2003). CRFs are log-linear, allowing the incorporation of arbi- trary features into the model. To train on unlabeled data, we require unsupervised estimation methods for log-linear models; few exist. We describe a novel approach, contrastive estimation. We show that the new technique can be intuitively understood as ex- ploiting implicit negative evidence and is computa- tionally efficient. Applied to a sequence labeling problem—POS tagging given a tagging dictionary and unlabeled text—contrastive estimation outper- forms EM (with the same feature set), is more robust to degradations of the dictionary, and can largely re- cover by modeling additional features.","authors":["Noah A.
