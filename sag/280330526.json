{"id":280330526,"name":"Geometric ergodicity of a random-walk Metropolis algorithm for a transformed density","abstraction":"We consider a Metropolis-Hastings method with proposal kernel $\\mathcal{N}(x,hG^{-1}(x))$, where $x$ is the current state. After discussing specific cases from the literature, we analyse the ergodicity properties of the resulting Markov chains. In one dimension we find that suitable choice of $G^{-1}(x)$ can change the ergodicity properties compared to the Random Walk Metropolis case $\\mathcal{N}(x,h\\Sigma)$, either for the better or worse. In higher dimensions we use a specific example to show that judicious choice of $G^{-1}(x)$ can produce a chain which will converge at a geometric rate to its limiting distribution when probability concentrates on an ever narrower ridge as $|x|$ grows, something which is not true for the Random Walk Metropolis.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200105001_Equation_of_State_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31403274_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_Using_Markov_Chains_and_Their_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47843593_The_Random_Walk_Metropolis_Linking_Theory_and_Practice_Through_a_Case_Study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265465075_Tweedie_RL_Rates_of_convergence_of_the_Hastings_and_Metropolis_algorithms_Ann_Stat_24_101-121","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2349384_Geometric_Convergence_and_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_Multidimensional_Hastings_and_Metropolis_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4920066_Convergence_of_Heavy-tailed_Monte_Carlo_Markov_Chain_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228789130_Examples_of_adaptive_MCMC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226460107_Langevin_Diffusions_and_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250613960_Kernel_Adaptive_Metropolis-Hastings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49458431_A_tutorial_on_adaptive_MCMC"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[200105001,31403274,47843593,265465075,2349384,4920066,228789130,226460107,250613960,49458431],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
