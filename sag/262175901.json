{"id":262175901,"name":"Review on Pattern based Document Modelling Techniques","abstraction":"Topic models are algorithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large and otherwise unstructured collection of documents. Topic models can organize the collection according to the discovered themes. Topic modeling algorithms can be applied to massive collections of documents. It can be adapted to many kinds of data. Among other applications, they have been used to find patterns in genetic data, images, and social networks. Topic modeling algorithms do not require any prior annotations or labeling of the documents, the topics emerge from the analysis of the original texts. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a topic model of document collections. Topic modeling algorithms generally fall into two categories, sampling-based algorithms and variational algorithms. Sampling-based algorithms attempt to collect samples from the posterior to approximate it with an empirical distribution. Variational methods are a deterministic alternative to sampling-based algorithms.","authors":["David M.
