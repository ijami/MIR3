{"id":215990321,"name":"FACTORIE: Efficient Probabilistic Programming for Relational Factor Graphs via Imperative Declarations of Structure, Inference and Learning","abstraction":"Representing high-order interactions in data often results in large models with an in- tractable number of hidden variables. In these models, inference and learning must op- erate without instantiating the entire set of variables. This paper presents a Metropolis- Hastings sampling approach to address this issue, and proposes new methods to discrimi- natively estimate the proposal and target dis- tribution of the sampler using a ranking func- tion over configurations. We demonstrate our approach on the task of paper and author deduplication, showing that our method en- ables complex, advantageous representations of the data while maintaining tractable learn- ing and inference procedures.","authors":["Aron Culotta"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251764291_FACTORIE_Efficient_Probabilistic_Programming_for_Relational_Factor_Graphs_via_Imperative_Declarations_of_Structure_Inference_and_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41013985_Author_name_disambiguation_in_MEDLINE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618661_FACTORIE_Probabilistic_Programming_via_Imperatively_Defined_Factor_Graphs"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45860532_Search-based_Structured_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45860555_Learning_as_Search_Optimization_Approximate_Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215470704_Incorporating_Non-local_Information_into_Information_Extraction_Systems_by_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228721051_Identity_uncertainty_and_citation_matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228333603_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Logic","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30815019_BLOG_Probabilistic_Models_with_Unknown_Objects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239067001_Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2937674_A_Linear_Programming_Formulation_for_Global_Inference_in_Natural_Language_Tasks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2899294_First-Order_Probabilistic_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012855_A_Learning_Field_Compatibilities_to_Extract_Database_Records_from_Unstructured_Text"],"citedInIDs":[251764291,41013985,221618661],"refrenceIDs":[45860532,45860555,215470704,228721051,228333603,30815019,239067001,2937674,2899294,221012855],"pageRank":8.47325713575647E-4}
