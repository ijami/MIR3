{"id":228671354,"name":"Strategies and Principles of Distributed Machine Learning on Big Data","abstraction":"During the last decade, the data sizes have grown faster than the speed of processors. In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning meth-ods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more pre-cise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing perfor-mance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set.","authors":["LÃ©on Bottou"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288889800_Strategies_and_Principles_of_Distributed_Machine_Learning_on_Big_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288713403_Robust_Semi-supervised_Least_Squares_Classification_by_Implicit_Constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288713780_Bridging_the_Gap_between_Stochastic_Gradient_MCMC_and_Stochastic_Optimization"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320158_SGD-QN_Careful_Quasi-Newton_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618614_The_Tradeoffs_of_Large_Scale_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320172_Trust_Region_Newton_Method_for_Logistic_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349018_Optimal_aggregation_of_classifiers_in_statistical_learning_Annals_of_Statististics_321","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346105_SVM_optimization_Inverse_dependence_on_training_set_size","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3079570_The_importance_of_convexity_in_learning_with_squared_loss","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239557089_The_perceptron_-_a_perceiving_and_recognizing_automaton","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224839970_Some_Methods_for_Classification_and_Analysis_of_MultiVariate_Observations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51964870_Towards_Optimal_One_Pass_Large_Scale_Learning_with_Averaged_StochasticGradient_Descent"],"citedInIDs":[288889800,288713403,288713780],"refrenceIDs":[220320158,221618614,221653970,220320172,38349018,221346105,3079570,239557089,224839970,51964870],"pageRank":7.205539801233925E-4}
