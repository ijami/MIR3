{"id":2469179,"name":"Flexible Random Intercept Models for Binary Outcomes Using Mixtures of Normals","abstraction":"this paper, we discuss a Bayesian method for the analysis of ordinal data. It is assumed that the ordinal data arise from an underlying latent variable which is related to a set of covariates in a generalized linear model sense. The link function which associates the class probabilities to the set of covariates is estimated as a finite mixture of probit links, thereby introducing flexibility in the choice of the link function. The Bayesian model provides an easy-to-implement simulation environment and therefore avoids pitfalls of the expensive and numerically unstable maximum likelihood analysis. The class probabilities are estimated by considering the predictive distribution of a future observation given the set of covariates. Computations are performed using Gibbs sampling. The method is illustrated by using both simulated and real data sets.","authors":["Peter Muller"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51403714_Flexible_Random_Intercept_Models_for_Binary_Outcomes_Using_Mixtures_of_Normals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2470994_A_general_class_of_hierarchical_ordinal_regression_models_with_applications_to_correlated_ROC_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228623852_Nonparametric_Bayesian_modeling_for_multivariate_ordinal_data"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359123_The_Analysis_of_Cross-Classified_Data_Having_Ordered_andor_Unordered_Categories_Association_Models_Correlation_Models_and_Asymmetry_Models_for_Contingency_Tables_With_or_Without_Missing_Entries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223706475_Maximum_likelihood_methods_for_linear_and_log-linear_models_in_categorical_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21244246_A_Monte_Carlo_Method_for_Bayesian_Inference_in_Frailty_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663734_Analysis_of_Ordinal_Categorical_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910629_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_Calculate_Marginal_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256557498_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Dichotomous_Quantal_Response_Models"],"citedInIDs":[51403714,2470994,228623852],"refrenceIDs":[38359123,38357862,223706475,21244246,230663734,224910629,38357634,256557498],"pageRank":6.909723896727282E-4}
