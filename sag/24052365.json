{"id":24052365,"name":"Neutral to the Right Processes from a Predictive Perspective: A Review and New Developments","abstraction":"We address the question as to whether a prior distribution on the space of distribution functions exists which generates the posterior produced by Efron\u0027s and Rubin\u0027s bootstrap techniques, emphasizing the connection with the Dirichlet process. We also introduce a new resampling plan which has two advantages: prior opinions are taken into account and the predictive distribution of the future observations is not forced to be concentrated on observed values.","authors":["P.
