{"id":280310254,"name":"Research into the inversion of the induced polarization relaxation time spectrum based on the uniform amplitude sampling method","abstraction":"The assessment of the functional failure probability of a thermal-hydraulic (T-H) passive system can be done by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling of the uncertainties affecting the T-H system model and its parameters. The computational effort associated to this approach can be prohibitive because of the large number of lengthy T-H code simulations necessary for the accurate and precise quantification of the (typically small) failure probability. To overcome this issue, in the present paper we propose an Adaptive Metamodel-Based Subset Importance Sampling (AM-SIS) approach that originally and efficiently combines the powerful features of several advanced computational methods of literature: in particular, Subset Simulation (SS) and fast-running Artificial Neural Network (ANN) metamodels are coupled within an adaptive MC-based Importance Sampling (IS) scheme. The objective is to construct a fully nonparametric estimator of the ideal, zero-variance Importance Sampling Density (ISD) and iteratively refine it, in such a way that: (i) the accuracy and precision of the corresponding failure probability estimates are improved and (ii) the number of burdensome T-H code runs is reduced, along with the associated computational cost. The method is demonstrated on a case study of an emergency passive decay heat removal system of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR). A thorough comparison is made with respect to several advanced MC methods of literature.","authors":["Enrico Zio"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265727384_Stochastic_Simulation_Algorithms_and_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281770821_Engineering_Risk_Assessment_with_Subset_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46587486_Sequential_design_of_computer_experiments_for_the_estimation_of_aprobability_of_failure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225469492_An_Efficient_Algorithm_for_Rare-event_Probability_Estimation_Combinatorial_Optimization_and_Counting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286431_Efficient_Monte_Carlo_simulation_via_the_generalized_splitting_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257665533_Markov_chain_importance_sampling_with_applications_to_rare_event_probability_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251516552_Assessing_small_failure_probabilities_by_combined_subset_simulation_and_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270788488_Reliability_Study_of_a_Special_Decay_Heat_Removal_System_of_a_Gas-Cooled_Fast_Reactor_Demonstrator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226439292_Approximation_by_superpositions_of_a_sigmoidal_function_Math_Cont_Sig_Syst_MCSS_2303-314","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51890126_Metamodel-based_importance_sampling_for_structural_reliability_analysis"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[265727384,281770821,46587486,225469492,220286431,257665533,251516552,270788488,226439292,51890126],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
