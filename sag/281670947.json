{"id":281670947,"name":"Fully Connected Neural Networks Ensemble with Signal Strength Clustering for Indoor Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","abstraction":"It has been shown that cooperative localization is capable of improving both the positioning accuracy and coverage in scenarios where the global positioning system (GPS) has a poor performance. However, due to its potentially excessive computational complexity, at the time of writing the application of cooperative localization remains limited in practice. In this paper, we address the efficient cooperative positioning problem in wireless sensor networks. A space-time hierarchical-graph based scheme exhibiting fast convergence is proposed for localizing the agent nodes. In contrast to conventional methods, agent nodes are divided into different layers with the aid of the space-time hierarchical-model and their positions are estimated gradually. In particular, an information propagation rule is conceived upon considering the quality of positional information. According to the rule, the information always propagates from the upper layers to a certain lower layer and the message passing process is further optimized at each layer. Hence, the potential error propagation can be mitigated. Additionally, both position estimation and position broadcasting are carried out by the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a sensor activation mechanism is conceived, which is capable of significantly reducing both the energy consumption and the network traffic overhead incurred by the localization process. The analytical and numerical results provided demonstrate the superiority of our space-time hierarchical-graph based cooperative localization scheme over the benchmarking schemes considered.","authors":["Tiejun Lv","Xiaopeng Li"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288480654_Fully_Connected_Neural_Networks_Ensemble_with_Signal_Strength_Clustering_for_Indoor_Localization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224235735_Network_Localization_and_Navigation_via_Cooperation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321630_Locating_the_Nodes_Cooperative_Localization_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224969478_Localization_via_ultra-wideband_radios_A_look_at_positioning_aspects_for_future_sensor_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273392190_Location-Aware_Communications_for_5G_Networks_How_location_information_can_improve_scalability_latency_and_robustness_of_5G","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224174416_Fundamental_Limits_of_Wideband_Localization-_Part_II_Cooperative_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235360575_Sensor_Selection_Based_on_Generalized_Information_Gain_for_TargetTracking_in_Large_Sensor_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3709997_Cooperative_search_and_rescue_with_a_team_of_mobile_robots","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224395252_UWB_Systems_for_Wireless_Sensor_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260580780_Network_Navigation_Theory_and_Interpretation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258555422_Dynamic_Bit_Allocation_for_Object_Tracking_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks"],"citedInIDs":[288480654],"refrenceIDs":[224235735,3321630,224969478,273392190,224174416,235360575,3709997,224395252,260580780,258555422],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
