We prove that E( vertical V//i vertical ) equals n/3 plus O(1), for i equals 1,2,3. This result tells us that the expected tree shape does not contain very long path subgraphs; thus in a sense the expected shape tends to be balanced.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275588184_Simple_Derivation_of_the_Lifetime_and_the_Distribution_of_Faces_for_a_Binary_Subdivision_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237107953_Statistics_Decisions_23_131-146_2005_c","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242761949_DOCTEUR_DE_L%27UNIVERSITE_DE_VERSAILLES_SAINT-QUENTIN"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[275588184,237107953,242761949],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":6.929589124779033E-4}
