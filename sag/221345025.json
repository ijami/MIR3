{"id":221345025,"name":"User Modeling for a Personal Assistant","abstraction":"Abstract Background The goal of clustering analysis is to partition objects into groups, such that members of each group are more â€œsimilarâ€? to each other than the members,of other groups. In this paper we describe methods,for using (supervised) SVM classifiers to perform unsupervised clustering and partially supervised clustering (projection). The former is accomplished by iteratively changing some of the label information and redoing the SVM training, the latter has no label alteration, but requires a set specified as the positives (a bag model, so partially supervised).
