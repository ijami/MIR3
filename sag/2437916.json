{"id":2437916,"name":"On a model of sequential point patterns","abstraction":"We show that a Poisson cluster point process is a nearest-neighbour Markov point process [2] if the clusters have uniformly bounded diameter. It is typically not a finite-range Markov point process in the sense of Ripley and Kelly [12]. Furthermore, when the parent Poisson process is replaced by a Markov or nearest-neighbour Markov point process, the resulting cluster process is also nearest-neighbour Markov, provided all clusters are nonempty. In particular, the nearest-neighbour Markov property is preserved when points of the process are independently randomly translated, but not when they are randomly thinned. 1. Introduction Markov or Gibbs point processes [2, 9, 12, 13] form a large, flexible, and understandable class of point process models with many practical advantages (see e.g. [4, 10, 11] for surveys). In this paper we consider the relationship of these models to the basic point process operation of clustering. We ask whether cluster processes are Markov, and whether the Mar...","authors":["A J Baddeley","M N M Van Lieshout","J Mller"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225624492_On_a_model_of_sequential_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228365876_Power_diagrams_and_interaction_process_for_unions_of_discs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2397620_Moment_Estimation_for_Statistics_From_Marked_Point_Processes"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232128911_Statistical_Inference_for_Spatial_Processes_Cambridge_University_Press_Cambridge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265375218_Nearest-Neighbour_Markov_Point_Processes_and_Random_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227076261_Exponential_spaces_and_counting_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265706044_Markov_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243777398_On_Parameter_Estimation_for_Pairwise_Interaction_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259104683_A_spatial_Markov_property_for_nearest-neighbour_Markov_point_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129036_A_nonparametric_measure_of_spatial_interaction_in_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246924933_Nearest_Neighbour_Mar_kov_Point_Processes_and_Random_sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267180586_Remarks_on_the_Spatial_Distribution_of_a_Reproducing_Population"],"citedInIDs":[225624492,228365876,2397620],"refrenceIDs":[232128911,265375218,227076261,265706044,243777398,259104683,232129036,246924933,267180586],"pageRank":6.011053088108499E-4}
