{"id":3233958,"name":"Joint Sparse Channel Estimation and Decoding: Continuous and Discrete Domain Sparsity","abstraction":"We present a unified graphical model framework for describing compound codes and deriving iterative decoding algorithms. After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl\u0027s (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including â€œturbo decodingâ€? of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes","authors":["Brendan J.
