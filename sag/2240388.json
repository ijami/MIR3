{"id":2240388,"name":"An Improved Multiobjective Optimization Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition for Complex Pareto Fronts","abstraction":"Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are often wellsuited for optimization problems involving several, often conflicting objectives. Since 1985, various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run. However, the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches. In this paper, four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis. Furthermore, we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization, the Strength Pareto EA (SPEA), that combines several features of previous multiobjective EAs in a unique manner. It is characterized by (a) storing nondominated solutions externally in a second, continuously updated population, (b) evaluating an individual\u0027s fitness dependent on the number of external nondominated points that domina...","authors":["Lothar Thiele"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271964468_An_Improved_Multiobjective_Optimization_Evolutionary_Algorithm_Based_on_Decomposition_for_Complex_Pareto_Fronts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290434617_Review_of_binary_tournament_constraint_handling_technique_in_NSGA_II_for_optimal_control_of_combined_sewer_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284719460_Pareto_or_Non-Pareto_Bi-Criterion_Evolution_in_Multi-Objective_Optimization"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30870312_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning_Addison-Wesley_Boston_MA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35578608_An_Analysis_of_the_Behavior_of_a_Class_of_Genetic_Adaptive_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220045412_Adoption_in_Natural_and_Artificial_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200622062_Knapsack_Problems_Algorithms_and_Computer_Implementation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3642940_An_interactive_fuzzy_satisficing_method_for_multiobjective_multidimensional_0-1_knapsack_problems_through_genetic_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2243429_A_Non-generational_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Multiobjective_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2754984_Finding_Multimodal_Solutions_Using_Restricted_Tournament_Selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216457304_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248122432_Tournament_Selection_Niching_and_the_Preservation_of_Diversity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3662832_Solving_large_knapsack_problems_with_a_genetic_algorithm"],"citedInIDs":[271964468,290434617,284719460],"refrenceIDs":[30870312,35578608,220045412,200622062,3642940,2243429,2754984,216457304,248122432,3662832],"pageRank":0.001179891005468412}
