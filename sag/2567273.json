{"id":2567273,"name":"Bayesian Learning in Undirected Graphical Models: Approximate MCMC algorithms","abstraction":"this article address a number of questions and needs in support of the practical development of such methods. First, we describe the general problem and context, and develop some theoretical insights into the nature and role of assumptions about model structure in its relation to the problem of inference on individual cell counts based on observation of sets of marginal totals. Then, we discuss MCMC approaches to joint analysis of parameters and missing cell counts. This uses a simple but flexible class of prior distributions on parameters of loglinear models at the parametric level. In imputing cell counts, we discuss, implement and evaluate \"local move\" algorithms that rely on Markov basis construction, together with a new class of \"global move\" approaches that have some relative attractions, especially as problems increase in dimension and complexity. A detailed discussion of an example demonstrates both the implementation and the e#cacy of the approaches, and we conclude with some discussion of current open issues and challenges. In addition to innovations in modelling and computation, the work represents a broad overview of the recent and current issues in this important field","authors":["Mike West"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157569_Bayesian_Learning_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models_Approximate_MCMCalgorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254871878_Recovering_transitions_from_repeated_cross_sections","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2128223_Sequential_importance_sampling_for_multiway_tables"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243770531_Monte_Carlo_Exact_Tests_for_Square_Contingency_Tables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2361948_Algebraic_Algorithms_for_Sampling_from_Conditional_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215446267_Monte_Carlo_Strategies_in_Scientic_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363276_A_Survey_of_Exact_Inference_for_Contegency_Tables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2867469_Bayesian_Graphical_Models_for_Discrete_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24056230_Graphical_models_in_applied_multivariate_statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50336265_The_Analysis_Of_Frequency_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242436300_Graphical_Models_In_Applied_Multivariate_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2676549_Statistical_Inference_For_Gravity_Models_In_Transportation_Flow_Forecasting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243768008_Statistical_Tools_for_Disclosure_Limitation_in_Multi-way_Contingency_Tables"],"citedInIDs":[229157569,254871878,2128223],"refrenceIDs":[243770531,2361948,215446267,38363276,2867469,24056230,50336265,242436300,2676549,243768008],"pageRank":6.180156680213055E-4}
