{"id":220816778,"name":"Joint Morphological Generation and Syntactic Linearization","abstraction":"For many language technology applications, such as question answering, the overall sys- tem runs several independent processors over the data (such as a named entity recognizer, a coreference system, and a parser). This eas- ily results in inconsistent annotations, which are harmful to the performance of the aggre- gate system. We begin to address this prob- lem with a joint model of parsing and named entity recognition, based on a discriminative feature-based constituency parser. Our model produces a consistent output, where the named entity spans do not conflict with the phrasal spans of the parse tree. The joint represen- tation also allows the information from each type of annotation to improve performance on the other, and, in experiments with the OntoNotes corpus, we found improvements of up to 1.36% absolute F1 for parsing, and up to 9.0% F1 for named entity recognition.","authors":["Jenny Rose Finkel"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266376360_Joint_Morphological_Generation_and_Syntactic_Linearization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248706484_Using_Empirically_Constructed_Lexical_Resources_for_Named_Entity_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013076_Training_dependency_parsers_by_jointly_optimizing_multiple_objectives"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215470704_Incorporating_Non-local_Information_into_Information_Extraction_Systems_by_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221102226_OntoNotes_Corpus_Cleanup_of_Mistaken_Agreement_Using_Word_Sense_Disambiguation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012856_Solving_the_Problem_of_Cascading_Errors_Approximate_Bayesian_Inference_for_Linguistic_Annotation_Pipelines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873596_Efficient_Feature-based_Conditional_Random_Field_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2353758_Inducing_Syntactic_Categories_by_Context_Distribution_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232632572_Unrestricted_Coreference_Identifying_Entities_and_Events_in_OntoNotes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817587_OntoNotes_The_90_Solution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45622657_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874174_Pipeline_Iteration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246586038_Joint_Parsing_and_Semantic_Role_Labeling"],"citedInIDs":[266376360,248706484,221013076],"refrenceIDs":[215470704,221102226,221012856,220873596,2353758,232632572,220817587,45622657,220874174,246586038],"pageRank":6.439991564343027E-4}
