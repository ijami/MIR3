{"id":273515460,"name":"Stephen H. Muggleton and Hiroaki Watanabe (Eds.): Latest advances in inductive logic programming","abstraction":"The field of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) has seen significant advances in the last 20 years, with many proposals for languages that combine probability with logic programming. Since the start, the problem of learning probabilistic logic programs has been the focus of much attention. Learning these programs represents a whole subfield of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). In Probabilistic ILP (PILP), two problems are considered: learning the parameters of a program given the structure (the rules) and learning both the structure and the parameters. Usually, structure learning systems use parameter learning as a subroutine. In this article, we present an overview of PILP and discuss the main results.","authors":["Elena Bellodi"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23561652_Probabilistic_Reasoning_With_Answer_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256465103_Structure_Learning_of_Probabilistic_Logic_Programs_by_Searching_the_Clause_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220485359_Inference_in_Probabilistic_Logic_Programs_using_Weighted_CNF%27s","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343698_Compressing_probabilistic_Prolog_programs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261798959_Inference_and_learning_in_probabilistic_logic_programs_using_weighted_Boolean_formulas","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2549567_Fuhr_N_Probabilistic_datalog_Implementing_logical_information_retrieval_for_advanced_applications_JASIS_512_95-110","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2425607_Inverse_entailment_and_Progol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220698885_First-Order_Bayes-Ball","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343808_Gradient-based_boosting_for_Statistical_Relational_Learning_The_Relational_Dependency_Network_Case","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220245439_Extended_semantics_and_inference_for_the_Independent_Choice_Logic"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[23561652,256465103,220485359,220343698,261798959,2549567,2425607,220698885,220343808,220245439],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
