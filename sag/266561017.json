{"id":266561017,"name":"Sampling in the Analysis Transform Domain","abstraction":"Many applications have benefited remarkably from low-dimensional models in the recent decade. The fact that many signals, though high dimensional, are intrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility to recover them stably from a relatively small number of their measurements. For example, in compressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix completion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a logarithmic factor) to the signal\u0027s manifold dimension. Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the cosparse analysis prior. In the noiseless case, it is possible to recover signals from this model, using a combinatorial search, from a number of measurements proportional to the signal\u0027s manifold dimension. However, if we ask for stability to noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all the existing results demand a number of measurements which is far removed from the manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask whether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if there exists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by relying only on their manifold dimension. In this work we show that the latter is true both in theory and in simulations. This gives a practical counter-example to the growing literature on compressed acquisition of signals based on manifold dimension.","authors":["Yaniv Plan","Roman Vershynin"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267395783_Sampling_in_the_Analysis_Transform_Domain","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272359217_The_generalized_Lasso_with_non-linear_observations"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220116567_From_Sparse_Solutions_of_Systems_of_Equations_to_Sparse_Modeling_of_Signals_and_Images","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220691600_Elad_M_Sparse_and_Redundant_Representations_From_Theory_to_Applications_in_Signal_and_Image_Processing_Springer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260637143_A_Theory_for_Sampling_Signals_From_a_Union_of_Subspaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265575276_A_mathematical_introduction_to_compressive_sensing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261673003_High-dimensional_estimation_with_geometric_constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7202352_Optimally_sparse_representation_in_general_nonorthogonal_dictionaries_via_l","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258818153_Can_we_allow_linear_dependencies_in_the_dictionary_in_the_sparse_synthesis_framework","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220617951_Sparse_Approximate_Solutions_to_Linear_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2805287_Atomic_Decomposition_by_Basis_Pursuit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3315110_Matching_Pursuit_with_Time-Frequency_Dictionaries"],"citedInIDs":[267395783,272359217],"refrenceIDs":[220116567,220691600,260637143,265575276,261673003,7202352,258818153,220617951,2805287,3315110],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
