{"id":2864441,"name":"Secure Anonymously Authenticated and Traceable Enterprise DRM System","abstraction":"We construct binary codes for fingerprinting. Our codes for n users that are ϵ-secure against c pirates have length O(c 2 log(n/ϵ)). This improves the codes proposed by D. Boneh and J. Shaw [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 44, 1897–1905 (1998; Zbl 0931.94051)] whose length is approximately the square of this length. Our codes are probabilistic. By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of these codes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error probabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found independently by C. Peikert, A. Shelat and A. Smith [in: Proceedings of the fourteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, Baltimore, MD, USA, January 12–14, 2003. New York, NY: Association for Computing Machinery; Philadelphia, PA: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 472–479 (2003; Zbl 1092.68605)] that applies to a limited class of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes over a binary alphabet are as powerful as those over an arbitrary alphabet, and also the equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.","authors":["Gabor Tardos"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282372777_Secure_Anonymously_Authenticated_and_Traceable_Enterprise_DRM_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280530763_Efficient_Robust_and_Secure_E-DRM_with_Encrypted_Content_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272193983_Optimal_sequential_fingerprinting_Wald_vs_Tardos"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080073_Tracing_Traitors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080362_Combinatorial_properties_of_frameproof_and_traceability_codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2611541_Resistance_of_Digital_Watermarks_to_Collusive_Attacks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220779228_Lower_Bounds_for_Collusion-Secure_Fingerprinting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3084733_Sequential_traitor_tracing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221348217_Optimum_Traitor_Tracing_and_Asymmetric_Schemes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722235_Error-_and_Collusion-Secure_Fingerprinting_for_Digital_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220342472_Guessing_Secrets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2383546_Fingerprinting_Digital_Documents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221355522_An_Efficient_Public_Key_Traitor_Tracing_Scheme"],"citedInIDs":[282372777,280530763,272193983],"refrenceIDs":[3080073,3080362,2611541,220779228,3084733,221348217,220722235,220342472,2383546,221355522],"pageRank":6.277665475172238E-4}
