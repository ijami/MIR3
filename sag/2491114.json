{"id":2491114,"name":"PEM-PCA: A parallel expectation-maximization PCA face recognition architecture","abstraction":"I present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA). The algorithm allows a few eigenvectors and eigenvalues to be extracted from large collections of high dimensional data. It is computationally very efficient in space and time. It also naturally accommodates missing information. I also introduce a new variant of PCA called sensible principal component analysis (SPCA) which defines a proper density model in the data space. Learning for SPCA is also done with an EM algorithm. I report results on synthetic and real data showing that these EM algorithms correctly and efficiently find the leading eigenvectors of the covariance of datasets in a few iterations using up to hundreds of thousands of datapoints in thousands of dimensions.","authors":["Sam Roweis"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263355993_PEM-PCA_A_parallel_expectation-maximization_PCA_face_recognition_architecture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261742005_Thalamus_and_posterior_temporal_lobe_show_greater_inter-network_connectivity_at_rest_and_across_sensory_paradigms_in_schizophrenia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257836555_Practical_ReProCS_for_Separating_Sparse_and_Low-dimensional_Signal_Sequences_from_their_Sum"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242630710_Turbulence_and_the_Dynamics_of_Coherent_Structures_I_II_and_III","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2811474_ARPACK_Users%27_Guide_Solution_of_Large-scale_Eigenvalue_Problems_by_Implicitly_Restarted_Arnoldi_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881862_Mixtures_of_Probabilistic_Principal_Component_Analysers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4771963_Probabilistic_Principal_Component_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44473500_The_algebraic_eigenvalue_problem_James_H_Wilkinson","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995817_Maximum_Likelihood_from_Incomplete_Data_Via_EM_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13338034_Mixtures_of_Probabilistic_Principal_Component_Analyzers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2798564_The_EM_Algorithm_for_Mixtures_of_Factor_Analyzers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2648965_Supervised_learning_from_incomplete_data_via_an_EM_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239049889_An_Introduction_to_Latent_Variable_Models"],"citedInIDs":[263355993,261742005,257836555],"refrenceIDs":[242630710,2811474,224881862,4771963,44473500,221995817,13338034,2798564,2648965,239049889],"pageRank":8.759896749022288E-4}
