{"id":2934935,"name":"A Multilingual FrameNet-based Grammar and Lexicon for Controlled Natural Language","abstraction":"This paper reports the results of experiments using memory-based learning to guide a deterministic dependency parser for unrestricted natural language text. Using data from a small treebank of Swedish, memory-based classifiers for predicting the next action of the parser are constructed. The accuracy of a classifier as such is evaluated on held-out data derived from the treebank, and its performance as a parser guide is evaluated by parsing the held-out portion of the treebank. The evaluation shows that memory-based learning gives a signficant improvement over a previous probabilistic model based on maximum conditional likelihood estimation and that the inclusion of lexical features improves the accuracy even further.","authors":["Jens Nilsson"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283761459_A_Multilingual_FrameNet-based_Grammar_and_Lexicon_for_Controlled_Natural_Language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262402839_A_transition-based_system_for_joint_part-of-speech_tagging_and_labeled_non-projective_dependency_parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262311224_Improving_transition-based_dependency_parsing_with_buffer_transitions"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2391268_Forgetting_Exceptions_is_Harmful_in_Language_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343419_Instance-Based_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2522415_A_Statistical_Parser_for_Czech","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224112437_The_Distance-Weighted_k-Nearest-Neighbor_Rule","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2813944_A_Memory-Based_Alternative_for_Connectionist_Shift-Reduce_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220424662_Toward_Memory-Based_Reasoning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2325198_Three_New_Probabilistic_Models_for_Dependency_Parsing_An_Exploration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243765369_Guides_and_oracles_for_linear-time_parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220355517_Head-Driven_Statistical_Models_for_Natural_Language_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2416202_Analogical_Modeling_of_Language"],"citedInIDs":[283761459,262402839,262311224],"refrenceIDs":[2391268,220343419,2522415,224112437,2813944,220424662,2325198,243765369,220355517,2416202],"pageRank":5.783394597448971E-4}
