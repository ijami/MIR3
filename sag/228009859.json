{"id":228009859,"name":"Fast Bayesian Matching Pursuit: Model Uncertainty and Parameter Estimation for Sparse Linear Models","abstraction":"Projection pursuit is concerned with \"interesting\" projections of high dimensional data sets, with finding such projections by machine, and with using them for nonparametric fitting and other data-analytic purposes. This survey attempts to put the fascinating problems and ramifications of projection pursuit--which range from principal components, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, nonparametric regression, density estimation and deconvolution of time series to computer tomography and problems in pure mathematics--into a coherent perspective","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254700729_Fast_Bayesian_Matching_Pursuit_Model_Uncertainty_and_Parameter_Estimation_for_Sparse_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140096_Experiments_with_Random_Projection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228680171_On_the_size_of_incoherent_systems"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280211_Three-Dimensional_Projection_Pursuit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2625269_Projection_Pursuit_Indices_Based_On_Orthonormal_Function_Expansions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103086_Projection_Pursuit_Indices_Based_on_the_Empirical_Distribution_Function","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103148_Projection_Pursuit_Clustering_for_Exploratory_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37433748_An_effective_two-dimensional_projection_pursuit_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37433798_Tools_for_Two-Dimensional_Exploratory_Projection_Pursuit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237476564_Technical_Report_0116_Tables_from_Robust_projection_indices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3046292_A_Projection_Pursuit_Algorithm_for_Exploratory_Data_Analysis_IEEE_Transactions_on_Computers_C-23_881-889","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244956627_A_generalized_projection_pursuit_procedure_and_its_significance_level","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223216966_Projection_pursuit_exploratory_data_analysis"],"citedInIDs":[254700729,234140096,228680171],"refrenceIDs":[2280211,2625269,243103086,243103148,37433748,37433798,237476564,3046292,244956627,223216966],"pageRank":0.0010113382580245764}
