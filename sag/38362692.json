{"id":38362692,"name":"Large deviation principles for the Ewens-Pitman sampling model","abstraction":"Consider a sample $X_1, \\cdots, X_n$ from a Dirichlet process $P$ on an uncountable standard Borel space $(\\mathscr{X}, \\mathscr{A})$ where the parameter $\\alpha$ of the process is assumed to be non-atomic and $\\sigma$-additive. Let $D(n)$ be the number of distinct observations in the sample and denote these distinct observations by $Y_1, \\cdots, Y_{D(n)}$. Our main results are (1) $D(n)/\\log n \\rightarrow_{\\operatorname{a.s.}} \\alpha(\\mathscr{X}), n \\rightarrow \\infty$, and (2) given $D(n), Y_1, \\cdots, Y_{D(n)}$ are independent and identically distributed according to $\\alpha(\\bullet)/\\alpha(\\mathscr{X})$. Result (1) shows that $\\alpha(\\mathscr{X})$ can be consistently estimated from the sample, and result (2) leads to a strong law for $\\sum^{D(n)}_{i\u003d1} Y_i/D(n)$.","authors":["Ramesh M.
