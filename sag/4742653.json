{"id":4742653,"name":"Another Look at DWD: Thrifty Algorithm and Bayes Risk Consistency in RKHS","abstraction":"High Dimension Low Sample Size statistical analysis is becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applied contexts. In such situations, it is seen that the appealing discrimination method called the Support Vector Machine can be improved. The revealing concept is data piling at the margin. This leads naturally to the development of Distance Weighted Discrimination,whichalsoisbasedonmoderncomputationally intensive optimization methods, and seems to give improved generalizability.","authors":["J.S.
