{"id":221345848,"name":"Inside Out: Two Jointly Predictive Models for Word Representations and Phrase Representations","abstraction":"We describe a single convolutional neural net- work architecture that, given a sentence, out- puts a host of language processing predic- tions: part-of-speech tags, chunks, named en- tity tags, semantic roles, semantically similar words and the likelihood that the sentence makes sense (grammatically and semanti- cally) using a language model. The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data ex- cept the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the general- ization of the shared tasks, resulting in state- of-the-art performance.","authors":["Ronan Collobert","Jason Weston"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287206748_Inside_Out_Two_Jointly_Predictive_Models_for_Word_Representations_and_Phrase_Representations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288713397_Recognizing_Entailment_and_Contradiction_by_Tree-based_Convolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287853493_Backbone_Language_Modeling_for_Constrained_Natural_Language_Generation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221101491_When_is_Self-Training_Effective_for_Parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2371584_Transductive_Inference_for_Text_Classification_Using_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2522500_Connectionist_Language_Modeling_For_Large_Vocabulary_Continuous_Speech_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873220_Using_Corpus_Statistics_on_Entities_to_Improve_Semi-supervised_Relation_Extraction_from_the_Web","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873245_The_Necessity_of_Parsing_for_Predicate_Argument_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817505_Shallow_Semantic_Parsing_using_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017689_The_Proposition_Bank_An_Annotated_Corpus_of_Semantic_Roles","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262406121_Dynamic_Conditional_Random_Fields_Factorized_Probabilistic_Models_for_Labeling_and_Segmenting_Sequence_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873558_Fast_Semantic_Extraction_Using_a_Novel_Neural_Network_Architecture"],"citedInIDs":[287206748,288713397,287853493],"refrenceIDs":[221101491,2371584,2522500,220873220,220873245,2985446,220817505,220017689,262406121,220873558],"pageRank":0.001428162509163541}
