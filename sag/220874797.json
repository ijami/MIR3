{"id":220874797,"name":"INLG2014 RDF","abstraction":"We present a new approach to relation ex- traction that requires only a handful of train- ing examples. Given a few pairs of named entities known to exhibit or not exhibit a particular relation, bags of sentences con- taining the pairs are extracted from the web. We extend an existing relation extraction method to handle this weaker form of su- pervision, and present experimental results demonstrating that our approach can reliably extract relations from web documents.","authors":["Razvan C.
