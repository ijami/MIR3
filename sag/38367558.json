{"id":38367558,"name":"Change point estimation of a normal process variance with monotonic change","abstraction":"It is shown that there exist strictly unbiased and consistent tests for the univariate and multivariate two- and $k$-sample problem, for the hypothesis of independence, and for the hypothesis of symmetry with respect to a given point. Certain new tests for the univariate two-sample problem are discussed. The large sample power of these tests and of the Mann-Whitney test are obtained by means of a theorem of Hoeffding. There is a discussion of the problem of tied observations.","authors":["E. L.
