{"id":4788953,"name":"Adaptive Multiple Importance Sampling for Gaussian Processes","abstraction":"Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models are commonly used to model spatial correlation in disease mapping applications. For Bayesian inference by MCMC, so far mainly single-site updating algorithms have been considered. However, convergence and mixing properties of such algorithms can be extremely bad due to strong dependencies of parameters in the posterior distribution. In this paper, we propose various block sampling algorithms in order to improve the MCMC performance. The methodology is rather general, allows for non-standard full conditionals, and can be applied in a modular fashion in a large number of different scenarios. For illustration we consider three different models: two formulations for spatial modelling of a single disease (with and without additional unstructured parameters respectively), and one formulation for the joint analysis of two diseases. We apply the proposed algorithms to two datasets known from the literature. The results indicate that the largest benef...","authors":["LEONHARD KNORR-HELD"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280773011_Adaptive_Multiple_Importance_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262954130_Pseudo-Marginal_Bayesian_Inference_for_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259010234_Bayesian_Inference_for_Gaussian_Process_Classifiers_with_Annealing_and_Exact-Approximate_MCMC"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2581125_Fast_Sampling_Of_Gaussian_Markov_Random_Fields_With_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14491630_Bayesian_Estimates_of_Disease_Maps_How_Important_Are_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30996602_On_Gibbs_Sampling_for_State_Space_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2242295_Conditional_simulation_from_highly_structured_Gaussian_systems_with_application_to_blocking-MCMC_for_the_Bayesian_analysis_of_very_large_linear_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12532548_Bayesian_Location_of_Clusters_and_Discontinuities_in_Disease_Maps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103678_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems_Rejoinder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13496301_Modelling_Risk_from_a_Disease_in_Time_and_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2606787_On_Conditional_and_Intrinsic_Autoregression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2298404_Conditional_Prior_Proposals_in_Dynamic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227659607_A_shared_component_model_for_joint_and_selective_clustering_of_two_diseases"],"citedInIDs":[280773011,262954130,259010234],"refrenceIDs":[2581125,14491630,30996602,2242295,12532548,243103678,13496301,2606787,2298404,227659607],"pageRank":5.740165537111691E-4}
