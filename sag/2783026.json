{"id":2783026,"name":"Nature is the code: high temporal precision and low noise in V1","abstraction":"In this paper, fully connected recurrent neural networks are investigated for blind separation of sources. For these networks, a new class of unsupervised on-line learning algorithms are proposed. These algorithms are the generalization of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian rule. They are not only biologically plausible but also theoretically sound. An important property of these algorithms is that the performance of the networks is independent of the mixing matrix and the scaling factor of the input sources. This property is verified by analyses and simulations. I. Introduction The problem of multi-channel blind separation of sources such as the \"cocktail-party\" problem arises in diverse fields in neural computation (including hearing and olfactory systems) and in applied science (including radar, speech processing and digital communication) . The problem is how to separate signal sources from the sensor output in which the sources are mixed in an unknown channel, a multiple-input multipleout...","authors":["S.
