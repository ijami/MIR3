In connection with herbicide application on a eld, it is important to map the weed intensity so that the dose of herbicide applied at any location can be adjusted to the amount of weed present at the location. In a Danish project on precision farming (Olesen, 1997) one objective was to investigate whether observations of soil properties could be used for prediction of weed intensity. In practice the farmer or his advisor should then establish a relation between soil properties and weed occurrence from extensive observations collected one year and use this for prediction of the weed intensity in subsequent years where only a limited number of weed count observations would be 1 collected. Many soil properties are fairly constant over time so that observations of soil samples obtained the rst year can also be used in subseq","authors":["Rasmus Waagepetersen"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258824735_Characterizing_the_spatial_dynamics_of_sympatric_Aedes_Aegypti_and_Aedes_Albopictus_populations_in_the_Philippines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227618233_A_non-stationary_spatial_generalized_linear_mixed_model_approach_for_studying_plant_diversity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265567947_Issues_and_Strategies_in_the_Selection_of_Composite_Likelihoods"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226261640_Efficient_sampling_from_the_posterior_distribution_in_generalized_linear_mixed_models_Statistics_and_Computing_7_57-68","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227672958_Optimal_scaling_of_discrete_approximations_to_Langevin_diffusions_J_R_Stat_Soc_Ser_B_Stat_Methodol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227647478_Model-Based_Geostatistic","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363225_Practical_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Stat_Sci_7_473-483","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2583743_Weak_Convergence_And_Optimal_Scaling_Of_Random_Walk_Metropolis_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2606787_On_Conditional_and_Intrinsic_Autoregression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227547717_Space-time_Multi_Type_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes_with_a_View_to_Modelling_Weeds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265423254_Approximate_Inference_In_Generalized_Linear_Mixed_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225261327_Geometric_Ergodicity_of_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms_for_Conditional_Simulation_in_Generalized_Linear_Mixed_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2319535_Objective_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Spatially_Correlated_Data"],"citedInIDs":[258824735,227618233,265567947],"refrenceIDs":[226261640,227672958,227647478,38363225,2583743,2606787,227547717,265423254,225261327,2319535],"pageRank":6.418159962140035E-4}
