{"id":220320803,"name":"Getting the Agenda Right: Measuring Media Agenda using Topic Models","abstraction":"LIBLINEAR is an open source library for large-scale linear classification. It supports logistic regres- sion and linear support vector machines. We provide easy-to-use command-line tools and library calls for users and developers. Comprehensive documents are available for both beginners and advanced users. Experiments demonstrate that LIBLINEAR is very efficient on large sparse data sets.","authors":["Rong-En Fan","Xiang-Rui Wang"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283455111_Getting_the_Agenda_Right_Measuring_Media_Agenda_using_Topic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279215570_Vehicle_Color_Recognition_With_Spatial_Pyramid_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282601760_LR-CNN_FOR_FINE-GRAINED_CLASSIFICATION_WITH_VARYING_RESOLUTION"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344925_Pegasos_Primal_estimated_sub-GrAdient_sOlver_for_SVM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215601307_A_Dual_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Large-scale_Linear_SVM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2376111_A_Training_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Margin_Classifier","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653418_A_sequential_dual_method_for_large_scale_multi-class_linear_SVMs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320172_Trust_Region_Newton_Method_for_Logistic_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215601308_Coordinate_Descent_Method_for_Large-scale_L2-loss_Linear_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220589055_A_Coordinate_Gradient_Descent_Method_for_Nonsmooth_Separable_Minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines"],"citedInIDs":[283455111,279215570,282601760],"refrenceIDs":[221344925,215601307,2376111,221653418,221653970,220320172,215601308,220589055,228715647],"pageRank":0.0011621751849240907}
