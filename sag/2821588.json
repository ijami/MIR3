{"id":2821588,"name":"Accelerating Metropolis-Hastings algorithms by Delayed Acceptance","abstraction":"this paper, we propose some solutions to these problems. Our goal is to come up with a simple, practical method for estimating the density. This is an interesting problem in its own right, as well as a first step towards solving other inference problems, such as providing more flexible distributions in hierarchical models. To see why the posterior is improper under the usual reference prior, we write the model in the following way. Let Z \u003d (Z 1 ; : : : ; Z n ) and X \u003d (X 1 ; : : : ; X n ).
