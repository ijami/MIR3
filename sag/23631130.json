{"id":23631130,"name":"Internal Regret with Partial Monitoring. Calibration-Based Optimal Algorithms","abstraction":"This paper presents some generalizations of S. N. Bernstein\u0027s exponential bounds on probabilities of large deviations to the vector case. Inequalities for probabilities of large deviations of sums of independent random vectors are derived under a Cram√©r\u0027s type restriction on the rate of growth of absolute moments of the summands. Estimates are obtained for random vectors with values in Banach space, Sharper bounds hold in the case of finite-dimensional Euclidean or separable Hilbert spaces.","authors":["V. V.
