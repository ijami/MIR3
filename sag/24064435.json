{"id":24064435,"name":"A new class of convex games on Ïƒ-algebras and the optimal partitioning of measurable spaces","abstraction":"Existential and constructive solutions to the classic problems of fair division are known for individuals with constant marginal evaluations. By considering nonatomic concave capacities instead of nonatomic probability measures, we extend some of these results to the case of individuals with decreasing marginal evaluations.
