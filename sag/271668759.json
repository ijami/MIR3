{"id":271668759,"name":"Genome-Wide Association Studies and Liver Disease","abstraction":"In genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to detect the disease-associated genetic variants, two-stage design has received much attention because of its cost effectiveness and high efficiency. Under the framework of a two-stage design, it has been shown that joint analysis is more powerful than replication-based analysis. Several robust tests have been proposed for joint analysis to handle the problem of unknown genetic mode of inheritance. However, existing joint analysis of combining test statistics from both stages might suffer from a loss of efficiency if the combined test statistics are not sufficient or the weight of the statistic for each stage is not appropriate. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for joint analysis by combining the raw data rather than the test statistics across stages and construct a robust MAX3-based test for two-staged GWASs, which can make full use of the information of the data from both stages. Our numerical results show that the proposed procedure is more powerful and computationally much faster than the existing joint analysis procedures. An application to a type 2 diabetes data set is used to illustrate the proposed approach.","authors":["Zheng-Bang Li","Qi-Zhai Li","Wing Kam Fung"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240277862_Armitage_P_Tests_for_Linear_Trends_in_Proportions_and_Frequencies_Biometrics_11_375-386","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51975447_A_Robust_Method_for_Testing_Association_in_Genome-Wide_Association_Studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228882905_Trend_Tests_for_Case-Control_Studies_of_Genetic_Markers_Power_Sample_Size_and_Robustness","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2463953_Numerical_Computation_Of_Multivariate_Normal_Probabilities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2466874_Comparison_of_Methods_for_the_Computation_of_Multivariate_Normal_Probabilities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6366335_Two-stage_designs_applying_methods_differing_in_costs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24418328_A_Robust_Test_for_Two-Stage_Design_in_Genome-Wide_Association_Studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232226233_On_the_relative_efficiency_of_using_summary_statistics_versus_individual_level_data_in_meta-analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49733411_Robust_joint_analysis_allowing_for_model_uncertainty_in_two-stage_genetic_association_studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30975436_Group_Sequential_Methods_in_the_Design_and_Analysis_of_Clinical_Trials"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[240277862,51975447,228882905,2463953,2466874,6366335,24418328,232226233,49733411,30975436],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
