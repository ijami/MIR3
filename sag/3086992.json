{"id":3086992,"name":"Task-group Relatedness and Generalization Bounds for Regularized Multi-task Learning","abstraction":"In this correspondence, we present a simple argument that proves that under mild geometric assumptions on the class F and the set of target functions T , the empirical minimization algorithm cannot yield a uniform error rate that is faster than 1/radic (k) in the function learning setup. This result holds for various loss functionals and the target functions from T that cause the slow uniform error rate are clearly exhibited.","authors":["Shahar Mendelson"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265169345_Task-group_Relatedness_and_Generalization_Bounds_for_Regularized_Multi-task_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228639624_On_the_optimality_of_the_aggregate_with_exponential_weights_for_low_temperatures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228538850_A_remark_on_non-exact_oracle_inequalities_with_applications_to_high-dimensional_data_analysis"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36840708_Introduction_to_Banach_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080728_Improving_the_sample_complexity_using_global_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060748_Concentration_inequalities_and_empirical_processes_theory_applied_to_the_analysis_of_learning_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247261571_Probability_Theory_An_Analytic_View","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41712113_Theory_of_Classification_A_Survey_of_Some_Recent_Advances","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2866564_Local_Rademacher_Complexities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663954_Weak_Convergence_and_Empirical_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239036776_Smoothness_and_Renormings_in_Banach_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222537720_Obtaining_fast_error_rates_in_nonconvex_situations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226444170_Geometric_Parameters_in_Learning_Theory"],"citedInIDs":[265169345,228639624,228538850],"refrenceIDs":[36840708,3080728,239060748,247261571,41712113,2866564,230663954,239036776,222537720,226444170],"pageRank":5.979406979947546E-4}
