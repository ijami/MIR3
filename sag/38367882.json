{"id":38367882,"name":"Tract Orientation and Angular Dispersion Deviation Indicator (TOADDI): A framework for single-subject analysis in diffusion tensor imaging","abstraction":"Let $x$ and $y$ be two random variables with continuous cumulative distribution functions $f$ and $g$. A statistic $U$ depending on the relative ranks of the $x$\u0027s and $y$\u0027s is proposed for testing the hypothesis $f \u003d g$. Wilcoxon proposed an equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic. Under the hypothesis $f \u003d g$ the probability of obtaining a given $U$ in a sample of $n x\u0027s$ and $m y\u0027s$ is the solution of a certain recurrence relation involving $n$ and $m$. Using this recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the probability of $U$ for samples up to $n \u003d m \u003d 8$. At this point the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment are obtained. The 2rth moment is shown to have a certain form which enabled us to prove that the limit distribution is normal if $m, n$ go to infinity in any arbitrary manner. The test is shown to be consistent with respect to the class of alternatives $f(x) \u003e g(x)$ for every $x$.","authors":["Henry B. Mann","Donald R.
