{"id":2251788,"name":"An adaptive learning damage estimation method for structural health monitoring","abstraction":"this paper to exhibit a general framework for hierarchical linear modelling and density estimation, to show how posterior computations via Markov chain simulations can be routinely applied, and to provide illustrations in each context. Section 2 provides a rather general theoretical setting and summarises key features of multivariate data models with hierarchical mixture priors. Section 3 discusses Markov chain simulation methods in these models, with special emphasis on models centred around traditional normal structures. Section 4 concerns an application in hierarchical regression, highlighting the use of mixture priors for robustness and sensitivity analysis, and Section 5 develops an application to multivariate density estimation. y","authors":["Mike West","Peter M"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279977982_An_adaptive_learning_damage_estimation_method_for_structural_health_monitoring","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51950172_Revisiting_k-means_New_Algorithms_via_Bayesian_Nonparametrics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258255076_Fast_Bayesian_Inference_in_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243689785_Illustration_of_Bayesian_Inference_in_Normal_Data_Models_Using_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265782246_On_the_Use_of_Discriminant_Functions_in_Taxonomy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241721720_Bayes_Methods_for_Combining_the_Results_of_Cancer_Studies_in_Humans_and_Other_Species","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257701639_Outlier_models_and_prior_distributions_in_Bayesian_linear_regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174"],"citedInIDs":[279977982,51950172,258255076],"refrenceIDs":[2741222,243689785,265782246,241721720,257701639,38357862],"pageRank":0.0018343324992773087}
