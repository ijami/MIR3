{"id":280104095,"name":"Wind speed model based on kernel density estimation and its application in reliability assessment of generating systems","abstraction":"This paper adopts a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model where the mixing distribution belongs to the wide class of normalized homogeneous completely random measures. We propose a truncation method for the mixing distribution by discarding the weights of the unnormalized measure smaller than a threshold. We prove convergence in law of our approximation, provide some theoretical properties and characterize its posterior distribution so that a blocked Gibbs sampler is devised. The versatility of the approximation is illustrated by two different applications. In the first the normalized Bessel random measure, encompassing the Dirichlet process, is introduced; goodness of fit indexes show its good performances as mixing measure for density estimation. The second describes how to incorporate covariates in the support of the normalized measure, leading to a linear dependent model for regression and clustering.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257247082_Modeling_with_Normalized_Random_Measure_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24082919_Modelling_the_distribution_of_stamp_paper_thickness_via_finite_normal_mixtures_The_1872_Hidalgo_stamp_issue_of_Mexico_revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257765539_Higher_transcendental_functions_Vol_III","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239061974_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_-_Volume_I_and_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233720862_A_Survey_of_Non-Exchangeable_Priors_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210269765_Table_of_Integrals_Series_and_Products","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24016279_Posterior_Analysis_for_Normalized_Random_Measures_with_Independent_Increments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4741797_Hierarchical_Mixture_Modeling_With_Normalized_Inverse-Gaussian_Priors"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[38357862,257247082,24082919,257765539,2741222,239061974,233720862,210269765,24016279,4741797],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
