{"id":2570964,"name":"Multiobjective optimisation on a budget: Exploring surrogate modelling for robust multi-reservoir rules generation under hydrological uncertainty","abstraction":"In recent years, a gradual increase in the sophistication of multiobjective evolutionary algo- rithms (MOEAs) for Pareto optimization has been seen, accompanied by an ever-growing list of applications. Despite this trend, however, the proposition that methods based on local search may be a good alternative approach -- with the advantages of ease-of-use and lower computational overhead -- has not been thoroughly tested. In this thesis we develop a novel, local-sear\u0026 algorithm for Pareto optimization, called PAES, enabling us to test and compare MOEAs against this philosophically different search method.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271445970_Multiobjective_optimisation_on_a_budget_Exploring_surrogate_modelling_for_robust_multi-reservoir_rules_generation_under_hydrological_uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261120557_An_algorithm_for_calculating_the_hypervolume_contribution_of_a_set","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225563839_The_efficiency_of_indicator-based_local_search_for_multi-objective_combinatorial_optimisation_problems"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23740136_When_Will_a_Genetic_Algorithm_Outperform_Hill-Climbing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220800153_Local_Search_in_Combinatorial_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280242_Future_Generation_Computer_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35578608_An_Analysis_of_the_Behavior_of_a_Class_of_Genetic_Adaptive_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300535_A_fast_elitist_non-dominated_sorting_genetic_algorithm_for_multi-objective_optimization_NSGA-II_KANGALRep_No_200001","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300639_Compaction_of_Symbolic_Layout_using_Genetic_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2690834_Niching_Methods_for_Genetic_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225510861_Designing_and_Reporting_on_Computational_Experiments_with_Heuristic_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300933_The_Pareto_Archived_Evolution_Strategy_A_New_Baseline_Algorithm_for_Pareto_Multiobjective_Optimisation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220471363_Degree-constrained_minimum_spanning_tree"],"citedInIDs":[271445970,261120557,225563839],"refrenceIDs":[23740136,220800153,2280242,35578608,216300535,216300639,2690834,225510861,216300933,220471363],"pageRank":0.00168913618559618}
