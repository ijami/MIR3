{"id":221345210,"name":"Infinite Structured Hidden Semi-Markov Models","abstraction":"The innite hidden Markov model is a non- parametric extension of the widely used hid- den Markov model. Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm for the innite Hidden Markov model called beam sam- pling. Beam sampling combines slice sam- pling, which limits the number of states con- sidered at each time step to a nite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories eciently. Our algo- rithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sam- pler and is more robust. We present appli- cations of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.","authors":["Jurgen Van Gael","Yee Whye Teh","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263582646_Infinite_Structured_Hidden_Semi-Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269164447_Pattern_discovery_in_continuous_speech_using_Block_Diagonal_Infinite_HMM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260428846_Modeling_the_Complex_Dynamics_and_Changing_Correlations_of_Epileptic_Events"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45860527_Bayesian_Agglomerative_Clustering_with_Coalescents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27290603_Gibbs_Sampling_Methods_for_Stick_-_breaking_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265369049_Slice_sampling_With_discussions_and_rejoinder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230600718_Numerical_Bayesian_Methods_Applied_to_Signal_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46451640_Sampling_the_Dirichlet_Mixture_Model_with_Slices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996674_The_Infinite_Gaussian_Mixture_Model"],"citedInIDs":[263582646,269164447,260428846],"refrenceIDs":[220270203,229100346,229100417,45860527,27290603,265369049,230600718,2741222,46451640,221996674],"pageRank":9.18979285927224E-4}
