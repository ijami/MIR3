{"id":3807947,"name":"Sequential Monte Carlo Methods in Practice","abstraction":"In this paper, we address the problem of sequential Bayesian model selection. This problem does not usually admit any closed-form analytical solution. We propose here an original sequential simulation-based method to solve the associated Bayesian computational problems. This method combines sequential importance sampling, a resampling procedure and reversible jump MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) moves. We describe a generic algorithm and then apply it to the problem of sequential Bayesian model order estimation of autoregressive (AR) time series observed in additive noise","authors":["Christophe Andrieu","Nando De Freitas"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140100_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225549514_A_Biologically_Inspired_Improvement_Strategy_for_Particle_Filter_Ant_Colony_Optimization_Assisted_Particle_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224560992_Relative_GPS_Carrier-Phase_Positioning_Using_Particle_Filters_with_Position_Samples"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2590205_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Dynamic_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3361206_Novel_Approach_to_NonlinearNon-Gaussian_Bayesian_State_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4772026_Following_a_moving_target-Monte_Carlo_inference_for_dynamic_Bayesian_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2796321_Dynamic_Conditional_Independence_Models_And_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357609_Markov_Chains_for_Exploring_Posterior_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3316982_Asymptotic_MAP_criteria_for_model_selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357612_Discussion_Markov_Chains_for_Exploring_Posterior_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222838919_Model_selection_by_MCMC_computation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261593363_Stochastic_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4895745_Bayesian_Inference_in_Econometric_Models_Using_Monte_Carlo_Integration"],"citedInIDs":[234140100,225549514,224560992],"refrenceIDs":[2590205,3361206,4772026,2796321,38357609,3316982,38357612,222838919,261593363,4895745],"pageRank":0.0010280960036770834}
