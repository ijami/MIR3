{"id":38358395,"name":"Scaled subordinators and generalizations of the Indian buffet process","abstraction":"Let $X_1, \\cdots, X_n$ be a random sample from an unknown $\\operatorname{cdf} F$, let $y_1, \\cdots, y_n$ be known real constants, and let $Z_i \u003d \\min(X_i, y_i), i \u003d 1, \\cdots, n$. It is required to estimate $F$ on the basis of the observations $Z_1, \\cdots, Z_n$, when the loss is squared error. We find a Bayes estimate of $F$ when the prior distribution of $F$ is a process neutral to the right. This generalizes results of Susarla and Van Ryzin who use a Dirichlet process prior. Two types of censoring are introduced--the inclusive and exclusive types--and the class of maximum likelihood estimates which thus generalize the product limit estimate of Kaplan and Meier is exhibited. The modal estimate of $F$ for a Dirichlet process prior is found and related to work of Ramsey. In closing, an example illustrating the techniques is given.","authors":["Thomas S. Ferguson","Eswar G.
