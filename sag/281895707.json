{"id":281895707,"name":"Asymptotics of Certain Coagulation-Fragmentation Processes and Invariant Poisson-Dirichlet Measures","abstraction":"Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets are naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we review the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a number of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of probability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP) through a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random fragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and relates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the Chinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical mixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar models in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be convincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical clustering and density modelling.","authors":["Hong Ge","Yarin Gal","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
