{"id":281716279,"name":"Prospective and Pavlovian mechanisms in aversive behaviour","abstraction":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports goal-directed actions and exerts cognitive control over behavior but the underlying coding and mechanism are heavily debated. We present evidence for the role of goal-coding in the PFC from two converging perspectives: computational modeling and neuronal-level analysis of monkey data. We show that neural representations of prospective goals emerge by combining a categorization process that extracts relevant behavioral abstractions from the input data and a reward-driven process that selects candidate categories depending on their adaptive value; both forms of learning have a plausible neural implementation in the PFC. Our analyses demonstrate a fundamental principle: goal-coding represents an efficient solution to cognitive control problems, analogous to efficient coding principles in other (e.g. visual) brain areas. The novel analytical-computational approach is of general interest since it applies to a variety of neurophysiological studies.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283511816_Prospective_and_Pavlovian_mechanisms_in_aversive_behaviour"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222553071_Goal-directed_control_and_its_antipodes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262779120_Human_cognition_Foundations_of_human_reasoning_in_the_prefrontal_cortex","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12122406_Freedman_DJ_Riesenhuber_M_Poggio_T_Miller_EK_Categorical_representation_of_visual_stimuli_in_the_primate_prefrontal_cortex_Science_291_312-316","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257350572_The_anatomy_of_choice_Active_inference_and_agency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274384343_The_Pre-Frontal_Cortex_Anatomy_Physiology_and_Neuropsychology_of_the_Frontal_Lobe","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259985798_Autonomous_Encoding_of_Irrelevant_Goals_and_Outcomes_by_Prefrontal_Cortex_Neurons","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234019992_Bayesian_non-parametrics_and_the_probabilistic_approach_to_modelling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5882538_Anterior_Prefrontal_Function_and_the_Limits_of_Human_Decision-Making","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274643641_Embodied_Choice_How_Action_Influences_Perceptual_Decision_Making","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12050870_An_Integrative_Theory_of_Prefrontal_Cortex_Function"],"citedInIDs":[283511816],"refrenceIDs":[222553071,262779120,12122406,257350572,274384343,259985798,234019992,5882538,274643641,12050870],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
