{"id":220812296,"name":"Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind","abstraction":"We present an overview of symbolic-statistical modeling language PRISM whose programs are not only a probabilistic extension of logic pro-grams but also able to learn from examples with the help of the EM learning algorithm. As a knowledge representation language appropriate for probabilistic reasoning, it can describe v ar-ious types of symbolic-statistical modeling for-malism known but unrelated so far in a sin-gle framework. We show by examples, to-gether with learning results, that most popular probabilistic modeling formalisms, the hidden Markov model and Bayesian networks, are de-scribed by PRISM programs.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280085209_Pattern_ActivationRecognition_Theory_of_Mind","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269339276_Declarative_Statistical_Modeling_with_Datalog","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261065893_Adaptive_MCMC-Based_Inference_in_Probabilistic_Logic_Programs"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220690966_Statistical_Language_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223712920_Probabilistic_Horn_abduction_and_Bayesian_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984124_Rabiner_L_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition_Proc_IEEE_772_257-286","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242419126_Probabilistic_Reasoning_in_Intelligent_Systems_Morgan_Kaufmann_Inc","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245989742_Dynamics_of_Sym_bol_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254333381_Tools_for_Statistical_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192118_A_Language_for_Construction_of_Belief_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14717130_Prediction_of_Protein_Secondary_Structure_by_the_Hidden_Markov_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257266655_Inductive_Logic_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2502699_A_Statistical_Learning_Method_for_Logic_Programs_with_Distribution_Semantics"],"citedInIDs":[280085209,269339276,261065893],"refrenceIDs":[220690966,223712920,2984124,242419126,245989742,254333381,3192118,14717130,257266655,2502699],"pageRank":9.70874883616909E-4}
