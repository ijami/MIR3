{"id":23632947,"name":"Negative dependence and the Simes inequality","abstraction":"A concept of negative dependence called negative dependence by stochastic ordering is introduced. This concept satisfies various closure properties. It is shown that three models for negetive dependence satisfy it and that it implies the basic negative orthant inequalities. This concept is also satisfied by the multinomial, multivariate hypergeometric. Dirichlet and Dirichlet compound multinomial distributions. Furthermore, the joint distribution of ranks of a sample and the multivariate normal with nonpositive pairwise correlations also satisfy this condition. The positive dependence analog of this condition is also studied.","authors":["Henry W. Block","Thomas H.
