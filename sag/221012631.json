{"id":221012631,"name":"CONQUER: Confusion Queried Online Bandit Learning","abstraction":"Confidence-Weighted linear classifiers (CW) and its successors were shown to perform well on binary and multiclass NLP problems. In this paper we extend the CW approach for sequence learning and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on four noun phrase chucking and named entity recognition tasks. We then derive few algorithmic approaches to estimate the prediction\u0027s correctness of each label in the output sequence. We show that our approach provides a reliable relative correctness information as it outperforms other alternatives in ranking label-predictions according to their error. We also show empirically that our methods output close to absolute estimation of error. Finally, we show how to use this information to improve active learning.","authors":["Avihai Mejer"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283433727_CONQUER_Confusion_Queried_Online_Bandit_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620124_Adaptive_Regularization_of_Weight_Vectors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51952269_Confidence_Estimation_in_Structured_Prediction"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344997_Confidence-weighted_linear_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2605436_Confidence_Estimation_for_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220816680_Flexible_Text_Segmentation_with_Structured_Multilabel_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220355455_Word-Level_Confidence_Estimation_for_Machine_Translation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228630734_Scalable_large-margin_online_learning_for_structured_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620124_Adaptive_Regularization_of_Weight_Vectors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873542_Exact_Decoding_for_Jointly_Labeling_and_Chunking_Sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1955094_Introduction_to_the_CoNLL-2000_Shared_Task_Chunking","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2526069_Discriminative_Training_Methods_for_Hidden_Markov_Models_Theory_and_Experiments_with_Perceptron_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873101_Online_Large-Margin_Training_of_Dependency_Parsers"],"citedInIDs":[283433727,221620124,51952269],"refrenceIDs":[221344997,2605436,220816680,220355455,228630734,221620124,220873542,1955094,2526069,220873101],"pageRank":5.846523346604434E-4}
