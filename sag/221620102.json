{"id":221620102,"name":"Gaussian Scale Mixture Models For Robust Linear Multivariate Regression With Missing Data","abstraction":"In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of proba- bilistic models. For each new application, however, it is currently necessary rst to derive the variational update equations, and then to implement them in application-specic code. Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. In this paper we describe a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (\u0027Variational Infer- ence for Bayesian Networks\u0027) which allows a wide variety of proba- bilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are specied either through a simple script or via a graphical interface analogous to a drawing package. VIBES then automatically generates and solves the vari- ational equations. We illustrate the power and exibilit y of VIBES using examples from Bayesian mixture modelling.","authors":["Christopher M. Bishop","David J.
