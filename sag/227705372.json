{"id":227705372,"name":"Accelerating and decelerating min-sum-based gear-shift LDPC decoders","abstraction":"A general framework, based on ideas of Tanner, for the description of codes and iterative decoding (â€œturbo codingâ€?) is developed. Just like trellis-based code descriptions are naturally matched to Viterbi decoding, code descriptions based on Tanner graphs (which may be viewed as generalized trellises) are naturally matched to iterative decoding. Two basic iterative decoding algorithms (which are versions of the algorithms of Berrou et al. and of Hagenauer, respectively) are shown to be natural generalizations of the forward-backward algorithm (Bahl et al.) and the Viterbi algorithm, respectively, to arbitrary Tanner graphs. The careful derivation of these algorithms clarifies, in particular, which a priori probabilities are admissible and how they are properly dealt with. For cycle codes (a class of binary linear block codes), a complete characterization is given of the error patterns that are corrected by the generalized Viterbi algorithm after infinitely many iterations.","authors":["Hansâ€?Andrea Loeliger","Ralf Kotter"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285614189_Accelerating_and_decelerating_min-sum-based_gear-shift_LDPC_decoders","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274644842_Joint_Noncoherent_Detection_and_Channel_Decoding_for_UWB_Impulse_Radio_by_Belief_Propagation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260542644_Counting_in_Graph_Covers_A_Combinatorial_Characterization_of_the_Bethe_Entropy_Function"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239195390_Low-Density_Parity-Check_Codes_for_the_Gilbert-Elliott_Channel","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3082386_Optimal_Decoding_of_Linear_Codes_for_Minimizing_Symbol_Error_Rate","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3083577_A_Recursive_Approach_to_Low_Complexity_Codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229754895_Cages-A_survey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984124_Rabiner_L_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition_Proc_IEEE_772_257-286","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237458464_Minimality_and_observability_of_group_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3078611_Densitylength_profiles_and_trellis_complexity_of_linear_block_codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235410288_Error_Correcting_Codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3604275_Near_Shannon_Limit_Error-Correcting_Coding_and_Decoding_Turbo_Codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236157550_Markov_Random_Fields_and_Their_Applications"],"citedInIDs":[285614189,274644842,260542644],"refrenceIDs":[239195390,3082386,3083577,229754895,2984124,237458464,3078611,235410288,3604275,236157550],"pageRank":0.0013313566850578797}
