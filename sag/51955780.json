{"id":51955780,"name":"Information Theory in Systems Biology: Gene Regulatory and Metabolic Networks","abstraction":"This chapter introduces some concentration inequalities for discrete-time martingales with bounded increments, and it exemplifies some of their potential applications in information theory and related topics. The first part of this chapter introduces briefly discrete-time martingales and the Azuma-Hoeffding \u0026 McDiardmid\u0027s inequalities which are widely used in this context. It then derives these refined inequalities, followed by a discussion on their relations to some classical results in probability theory. It also considers a geometric interpretation of some of these inequalities, providing an insight on the inter-connections between them. The second part exemplifies the use of these refined inequalities in the context of hypothesis testing, information theory, communications, and coding. The chapter is concluded with a discussion on some directions for further research.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224506304_Channel_Polarization_A_Method_for_Constructing_Capacity-Achieving_Codes_for_Symmetric_Binary-Input_Memoryless_Channels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38370094_Weighted_sums_of_certain_dependent_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243699036_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_of_Independent_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3082428_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Information_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228471717_Complex_graphs_and_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2450433_Moderate_Deviations_For_Martingales_With_Bounded_Jumps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3079907_Which_Codes_Have_Cycle-Free_Tanner_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38362521_On_Tail_Probabilities_for_Martingales","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224078325_On_the_Redundancy_of_Slepian-Wolf_Coding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1906867_Information_Spectrum_Approach_to_Second-Order_Coding_Rate_in_Channel_Coding"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[224506304,38370094,243699036,3082428,228471717,2450433,3079907,38362521,224078325,1906867],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
