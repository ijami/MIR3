{"id":24058793,"name":"Network Non-Neutrality through Preferential Signaling","abstraction":"We exhibit a general class of interactive decision situations in which all the agents benefit from more information. This class includes as a special case the classical comparison of statistical experiments a la Blackwell. More specifically, we consider pairs consisting of a game with incomplete information G and an information structure L such that the extended game Gamma(G, L) has a unique Pareto payoff profile u. We prove that u is a Nash payoff profile of Gamma(G, L), and that for any information structure T that is coarser than S, all Nash payoff profiles of Gamma(G, T) are dominated by u. We then prove that our condition is also necessary in the following sense: Given any convex compact polyhedron of payoff profiles, whose Pareto frontier is not a singleton, there exists an extended game Gamma(G, L) with that polyhedron as the convex hull of feasible payoffs, an information structure T coarser than L and a player i who strictly prefers a Nash equilibrium in Gamma(G, T) to any Nash equilibrium in Gamma(G, L).","authors":["Olivier Gossner","Bruno Bassan"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261420852_Network_Non-Neutrality_through_Preferential_Signaling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235386627_The_Value_of_Private_Patient_Information_in_the_Physician-Patient_Relationship_A_Game-Theoretic_Account","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239280577_When_is_the_value_of_public_information_positive_in_a_game"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4980093_Credit_Rationing_Wealth_Inequality_and_Allocation_of_Talent","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38360286_Comparing_Location_Experiments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222520566_Certainty_Independence_and_the_Separation_of_Utility_and_Beliefs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4721472_The_Private_And_Social_Value_of_Information_And_The_Reward_To_Inventive_Activity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222651769_A_Characterization_of_the_Core_of_Convex_Games_Through_Gateaux_Derivatives","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226592088_The_value_of_perfect_information_in_nonlinear_utility_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222582578_Expected_Utility_Theory_Without_the_Completeness_Axiom","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2362707_A_Subjective_Spin_on_Roulette_Wheels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2524007_Ambiguity_From_The_Differential_Viewpoint","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222564009_Decision_Making_with_Imprecise_Probabilistic_Information"],"citedInIDs":[261420852,235386627,239280577],"refrenceIDs":[4980093,38360286,222520566,4721472,222651769,226592088,222582578,2362707,2524007,222564009],"pageRank":6.359417756313632E-4}
