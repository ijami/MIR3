{"id":223164217,"name":"Bifurcation analysis on a generalized recurrent neural network with two interconnected three-neuron components","abstraction":"A neural network model of temporal pattern memory in animal motor systems is proposed. First, the network receives an external oscillatory input with some desired wave form, then, after sufficient learning, the network autonomously oscillates in the previously given wave form. The network has three layers. Each of the units is a continuous-time continuous-output model neuron, which is not oscillatory by itself. The wave form of the autonomous oscillation is memorized in the connecting weights between the units. The back-propagation learning algorithm is modified and applied to the continuous-time recurrent networks. The abilities of the network and the learning algorithm are examined by computer simulations. Studies on such artificial neural oscillators will be helpful in understanding the roles of complex synaptic connections between the motorneurons and the interneurons observed in the motor nervous systems of animals.","authors":["Kenji Doya","Shuji Yoshizawa"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258277098_Bifurcation_analysis_on_a_generalized_recurrent_neural_network_with_two_interconnected_three-neuron_components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/52004955_Permanent_oscillations_in_a_3-node_recurrent_neural_network_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38041699_MODEM_A_multi-agent_hierarchical_structure_to_model_the_human_motor_control_system"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222458638_A_consideration_of_invertebrate_central_pattern_generators_as_computational_data_bases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22477923_Neuronal_generation_of_the_leech_swimming_movement_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233822960_Adaptive_Signal_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4658191_Winter_R_Neural_nets_for_adaptive_filtering_and_adaptive_pattern_recognition_Computer_21_25-39","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18794717_Allen_GI_Tsukahara_NCerebrocerebellar_communication_systems_Physiol_Rev_54957-1006","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223405153_Statistical_neurodynamics_of_associative_memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226654233_Generation_of_locomotory_rhythm_by_a_neural_network_with_recurrent_cyclic_inhibition_Biol_Cybern","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228068928_Fujita_M_Adaptive_filter_model_of_the_cerebellum_Biol_Cybern_45_195-206","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22010174_Locomotion_in_vertebrates_central_mechanisms_and_reflex_interaction_Physiol_Rev","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22544742_The_spinal_locomotor_generator_Exp_Brain_Res"],"citedInIDs":[258277098,52004955,38041699],"refrenceIDs":[222458638,22477923,233822960,4658191,18794717,223405153,226654233,228068928,22010174,22544742],"pageRank":6.907537063657046E-4}
