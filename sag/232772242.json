{"id":232772242,"name":"Evaluation of hypothesis testing for comparing two populations using NONMEM analysis. J Pharmacokinet Biopharm 20: 295-313","abstraction":"Netilmicin pharmacokinetics were studied in neonates of 27 to 42 weeks\u0027 gestational age and 0.8 to 5.0 kg body weight in their first 2 weeks of life by the population pharmacokinetic approach. The data were best described by a two-compartment model. Clearance depends on body weight, gestational age, and postnatal age. Volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments was also related to body weight. Including these patient characteristics in the population pharmacokinetic regression model resulted in a marked reduction of the unexplained interindividual variability. This enabled us to derive dosage recommendations that result in peak and average concentrations within the desired range for 95% of the neonates with gestational age above 31 weeks, thus avoiding the need for individual drug-level monitoring in a well-defined large group of patients. Only for infants with gestational age less than 31 weeks who are less than 6 days old is individual dose adjustment based on serum concentration measurements required.","authors":["Karin Fattinger","Samuel Vozeh","Arni Olafsson","Jiri Vlcek","Markus Wenk"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21632206_Evaluation_of_hypothesis_testing_for_comparing_two_populations_using_NONMEM_analysis_J_Pharmacokinet_Biopharm_20_295-313","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21677726_Time_Course_of_Trough_Serum_Gentamicin_Concentrations_in_Preterm_and_Term_Neonates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279374975_The_Population_Approach_Rationale_Methods_and_Applications_in_Clinical_Pharmacology_and_Drug_Development"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19181265_Clinical_pharmacology_of_netilmicin_in_preterm_and_term_infants","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19204510_Pharmacokinetics_of_netilmicin_in_premature_infants","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16092066_Pharmacokinetic_assessment_of_Netilmicin_in_newborns_and_older_children","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22714792_Pharmacokinetic_Properties_of_Netilmicin_in_Newborn_Infants","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19401026_A_simple_estimate_of_glomerular_filtration_rate_in_low_birth_weight_infants_during_the_first_year_of_life_non_invasive_assessment_of_body_composition_and_growth_J_Pediatr_109_698-707","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22622689_Multicompartment_pharmacokinetics_of_netilmicin","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22228838_Estimation_of_Population_Characteristics_of_Pharmacokinetic_Parameters_from_Routine_Clinical_Dat","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277436665_Population_Pharmacokinetics_of_Alfentanil"],"citedInIDs":[21632206,21677726,279374975],"refrenceIDs":[19181265,19204510,16092066,22714792,19401026,22622689,22228838,277436665],"pageRank":6.235205544854544E-4}
