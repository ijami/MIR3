{"id":3086721,"name":"Cognitive Radio MIMO Gaussian Broadcast Channels with the Power Constraint","abstraction":"In this paper, we investigate the capacity and capacity-achieving input probability distributions (IPDs) of finite-input-finite-output discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). In the general respect, we establish a novel and simple characterization for the capacity-achieving IPDs of a DMC, which is equivalent to the conventional Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We then prove a conjecture of Majani and Rumsey, which claims that every probability component of each capacity-achieving IPD of a DMC with positive capacity is less than 1-e-1, where e \u003d 2.71828182... is the base of natural logarithms. It remains an open problem whether there exists an explicit closed-form solution for the capacity and capacity-achieving IPDs of a general finite-input-finite-output DMC, except for the two-input-two-output DMC. In the algebraic respect, we demonstrate that there does not, in general, exist an algebraic solution for the capacity-achieving IPDs of an m-input-n-output DMC for any m ges 2 . and any n ges 3. In the analytic respect, however, we can obtain an explicit closed-form analytic solution, represented as an infinite series, for the capacity-achieving IPD of a two-input-three-output DMC. We also provide a formula for the average capacity of weakly symmetric DMCs and show that the average capacity in nats per channel use of the n-input-m-output weakly symmetric DMCs increases for n ges 2 but has a finite limit of 1 - gamma as n rarr infin, where gamma \u003d 0.57721566... is Euler\u0027s constant. In the algorithmic respect, the convergence of the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm is proved in a direct and elementary way. A new and simple iterative algorithm for calculating a capacity-achieving IPD is then proposed, which is provably convergent for all DMCs with positive transition probabilities. Finally, the characterization and determination of the set of all capacity-achieving IPDs of a DMC are addressed.","authors":["Xue-Bin Liang"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257674910_Cognitive_Radio_MIMO_Gaussian_Broadcast_Channels_with_the_Power_Constraint","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257675336_On_the_Sum_Rate_Capacity_of_MIMO_Broadcast_Channels_in_Cognitive_Radio_Networks_with_Interference_Power_Constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221289500_CTH04-5_A_New_Iterative_Algorithm_for_Calculating_the_Capacity_of_Discrete_Memoryless_Channels"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242930016_A_Posteriori_Error_Bounds_for_the_Linearly-Constrained_Variational_Inequality_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243550232_On_the_Capacity_of_a_Discrete_Channel_I_Mathematical_expression_of_capacity_of_a_channel_which_is_disturbed_by_noise_in_its_every_one_symbol_and_expressible_in_one_state_diagram","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220588703_Finite-Dimensional_Variational_Inequality_and_Nonlinear_Complementarity_Problems_A_Survey_of_Theory_Algorithms_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3082056_Computation_of_channel_capacity_and_rate_distortion_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3084967_Geometric_Programming_Duals_of_Channel_Capacity_and_Rate_Distortion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42635916_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247039577_On_the_extreme_points_of_regularly_convex_sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4108979_On_a_conjecture_of_Majani_and_Rumsey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3081924_An_Algorithm_for_Computing_the_Capacity_of_Arbitrary_Discrete_Memoryless_Channels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3081154_On_a_bound_for_channel_capacity_Corresp"],"citedInIDs":[257674910,257675336,221289500],"refrenceIDs":[242930016,243550232,220588703,3082056,3084967,42635916,247039577,4108979,3081924,3081154],"pageRank":5.979406979947546E-4}
