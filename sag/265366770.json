{"id":265366770,"name":"Fully Bayesian hierarchical modelling in two stages, with application to meta-analysis","abstraction":"A fully Bayesian analysis of linear and nonlinear population models has previously been unavailable, as a consequence of the seeming impossibility of performing the necessary numerical integrations in the complex multiparameter structures that typically arise in such models. It is demonstrated that, for a variety of linear and nonlinear population models, a fully Bayesian analysis can be implemented in a straightforward manner by using the Gibbs sampler. The approach is illustrated with examples involving challenging problems of outliers and mean-variance relationships in population modelling.","authors":["J.C. Wakefield","A.F.M. Smith","A.E.
