{"id":233530327,"name":"Non-Orthogonal Explicit Semantic Analysis","abstraction":"Measuring the semantic relatedness between two entities is the basis for numerous tasks in IR, NLP, and Web-based knowledge extraction. This paper focuses on disambiguating names in a Web or text document by jointly mapping all names onto semantically related entities registered in a knowledge base. To this end, we have developed a novel notion of semantic relatedness between two entities represented as sets of weighted (multi-word) keyphrases, with consideration of partially overlapping phrases. This measure improves the quality of prior link-based models, and also eliminates the need for (usually Wikipedia-centric) explicit interlinkage between entities. Thus, our method is more versatile and can cope with long-tail and newly emerging entities that have few or no links associated with them. For efficiency, we have developed approximation techniques based on min-hash sketches and locality-sensitive hashing. Our experiments on semantic relatedness and on named entity disambiguation demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art baselines.","authors":["Dat Ba Nguyen","Martin Theobald","Gerhard Weikum"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282858129_Non-Orthogonal_Explicit_Semantic_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261849268_Methods_for_exploring_and_mining_tables_on_Wikipedia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259045476_Statistical_Analyses_of_Named_Entity_Disambiguation_Benchmarks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200042361_TextRank_Bringing_Order_into_Texts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2320094_Approximate_Nearest_Neighbors_Towards_Removing_the_Curse_of_Dimensionality","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221023177_Placing_search_in_context_The_concept_revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874817_Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220138767_Ordering_by_weighted_number_of_wins_gives_a_good_ranking_for_weighted_tournaments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875063_Knowledge-Rich_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_Rivaling_Supervised_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299797_Acquisition_of_instance_attributes_via_labeled_and_related_instances","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200772975_Evaluating_WordNet-based_Measures_of_Lexical_Semantic_Relatedness","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220566219_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_A_Survey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221101889_Entity_Disambiguation_for_Knowledge_Base_Population"],"citedInIDs":[282858129,261849268,259045476],"refrenceIDs":[200042361,2320094,221023177,220874817,220138767,220875063,221299797,200772975,220566219,221101889],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
