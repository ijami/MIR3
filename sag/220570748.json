{"id":220570748,"name":"Using the doubling dimension to analyze the generalization of learning algorithms","abstraction":"A proof that a concept is learnable provided the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension is nite is given. The proof is more explicit than previous proofs and introduces two new parameters which allow bounds on the sample size obtained to be improved by a factor of approximately 4log 2 (e). Keywords: learning, Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC), sample. 2 1 Introduction The problem of deciding what sample size is needed to guarantee accurate learning in Valiant\u0027s Probably Approximately Correct [Vali84] sense has received much attention in the literature. This has been brought into focus by the current interest in connectionist models of learning. Many experimental results have been obtained with these models but there is little theory to justify their generality. The rst inroads into this area were made by Pitt and Valiant [PiVa] and Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler and Warmuth [BEHW87], who pointed out that if the number r of hypotheses is nite then the probab...","authors":["Martin Anthony","Norman Biggs"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222666872_Using_the_doubling_dimension_to_analyze_the_generalization_of_learning_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220812129_Generalization_Bounds_for_Weighted_Binary_Classification_with_Applications_to_Statistical_Verification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220574154_Learning_with_side_information_PAC_learning_bounds"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234793335_A_theory_of_the_learnable_Commun_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242326394_E-net_and_simplex_range_queries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225788704_Nets_and_Simplex_Range_Queries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222453050_Quantifying_inductive_bias_AI_learning_algorithms_and_Valiant%27s_learning_framework_Artif_Intell","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30875797_A_Theory_of_the_Learnable","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220430853_Learnability_and_the_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_dimension_J_ACM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220432245_Computational_limitations_on_learning_from_examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233784971_On_the_Uniform_Convergence_of_Relative_Frequencies_of_Events_to_Their_Probabilities"],"citedInIDs":[222666872,220812129,220574154],"refrenceIDs":[234793335,242326394,225788704,222453050,30875797,220430853,220432245,233784971],"pageRank":8.813381364806925E-4}
