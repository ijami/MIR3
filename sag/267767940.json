{"id":267767940,"name":"Latent Gaussian Processes for Distribution Estimation of Multivariate Categorical Data","abstraction":"Variational Message Passing (VMP) is an algorithmic implementation of the Vari-ational Bayes (VB) method which applies only in the special case of conjugate exponential family models. We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expecta-tions are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regres-sion. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the soft-max factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability.","authors":["Thomas P Minka"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388187_Latent_Gaussian_Processes_for_Distribution_Estimation_of_Multivariate_Categorical_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272845343_Latent_quality_models_for_document_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51893132_Approximate_inference_via_variational_sampling"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346428_Piecewise_Bounds_for_Estimating_Bernoulli-Logistic_Latent_Gaussian_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618475_Parameter_Expanded_Variational_Bayesian_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320406_Building_Blocks_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2694888_A_Mean_Field_Learning_Algorithm_For_Unsupervised_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254212653_Mean_Field_Variational_Bayes_for_Elaborate_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24052099_Multinomial_logistic_regression_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270112_Variational_Bounds_for_Mixed-Data_Factor_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251955941_Efficient_Bounds_for_the_Softmax_Function_and_Applications_to_Approximate_Inference_in_Hybrid_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320310_Variational_Message_Passing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2365311_A_variational_approach_to_Bayesian_logistic_regression_models_and_their_extensions"],"citedInIDs":[273388187,272845343,51893132],"refrenceIDs":[221346428,221618475,220320406,2694888,254212653,24052099,220270112,251955941,220320310,2365311],"pageRank":5.773000332215996E-4}
