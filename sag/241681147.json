{"id":241681147,"name":"Bernstein von Mises Theorems in Wasserstein distance","abstraction":"The frequentist behavior of nonparametric Bayes estimates, more specifically, rates of contraction of the posterior distributions to shrinking Lr-norm neighborhoods, 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞, of the unknown parameter, are studied. A theorem for nonparametric density estimation is proved under general approximation-theoretic assumptions on the prior. The result is applied to a variety of common examples, including Gaussian process, wavelet series, normal mixture and histogram priors. The rates of contraction are minimax-optimal for 1 ≤ r ≤ 2, but deteriorate as r increases beyond 2. In the case of Gaussian nonparametric regression a Gaussian prior is devised for which the posterior contracts at the optimal rate in all Lr-norms, 1 ≤ r ≤ ∞.","authors":["Richard Nickl"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272195358_Bernstein_von_Mises_Theorems_in_Wasserstein_distance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268820328_Supremum_Norm_Posterior_Contraction_and_Credible_Sets_for_Nonparametric_Multivariate_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257528435_On_the_Bernstein-von_Mises_phenomenon_for_nonparametric_Bayes_procedures"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226747117_Approximation_dans_les_espaces_mtriques_et_thorie_de_l%27estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2567002_Posterior_Consistency_Of_Dirichlet_Mixtures_In_Density_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31102892_Towards_a_Practicable_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Density_Estimator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781172_Concentration_Inequalities_for_Sub-Additive_Functions_Using_the_Entropy_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222459597_Existence_of_small_ball_constants_for_fractional_Brownian_motions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1760168_Posterior_convergence_rates_of_Dirichlet_mixtures_at_smooth_densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239666920_Asymptotic_Methods_in_Statistical_Decision_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1760503_On_local_U-statistic_processes_and_the_estimation_of_densities_of_functions_of_several_sample_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226496454_The_Brunn-Minkowski_inequality_in_Gauss_space_Invent_Math_30_207-216","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1737341_Vaart_AW_van_Zanten_JH_Rates_of_contraction_of_posterior_distributions_based_on_Gaussian_process_priors_Ann_Statist_36_1435-1463"],"citedInIDs":[272195358,268820328,257528435],"refrenceIDs":[226747117,2567002,31102892,41781172,222459597,1760168,239666920,1760503,226496454,1737341],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
