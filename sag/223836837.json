{"id":223836837,"name":"Hebbian learning from higher-order correlations requires crosstalk minimization","abstraction":"A number of neural learning rules have been recently proposed for independent component analysis (ICA). The rules are usually derived from information-theoretic criteria such as maximum entropy or minimum mutual information. In this paper, we show that in fact, ICA can be performed by very simple Hebbian or anti-Hebbian learning rules, which may have only weak relations to such information-theoretical quantities. Rather surprisingly, practically any nonlinear function can be used in the learning rule, provided only that the sign of the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian term is chosen correctly. In addition to the Hebbian-like mechanism, the weight vector is here constrained to have unit norm, and the data is preprocessed by prewhitening, or sphering. These results imply that one can choose the non-linearity so as to optimize desired statistical or numerical criteria.","authors":["Aapo Hyv√§rinen"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262644830_Hebbian_learning_from_higher-order_correlations_requires_crosstalk_minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262301977_A_Neuron_as_a_Signal_Processing_Device","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262366592_A_Neuron_as_a_Signal_Processing_Device"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15614030_An_Information-Maximization_Approach_to_Blind_Separation_and_Blind_Deconvolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222489418_Independent_Component_Analysis_a_New_Concept","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265374435_Exploratory_Projection_Pursuit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222460491_Minor_components_and_linear_neural_networks_Neural_Networks_5_927-935","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2429846_The_Nonlinear_PCA_Learning_Rule_and_Signal_Separation_-_Mathematical_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3077560_Weinstein_E_New_criteria_for_blind_deconvolution_of_nonminimum_phase_systems_channels_IEEE_Transactions_on_Information_Theory_362_312-321","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2611505_A_New_Learning_Algorithm_for_Blind_Signal_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222451603_Karhunen_J_On_Stochastic_Approximation_of_the_Eigenvectors_and_Eigenvalues_of_the_Expectation_of_a_Random_Matrix_Journal_of_Mathematical_Analysis_and_Applications_106_69-84","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223694041_The_Nonlinear_PCA_Learning_Rule_in_Independent_Component_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223667213_Robust_fitting_by_nonlinear_neural_units"],"citedInIDs":[262644830,262301977,262366592],"refrenceIDs":[15614030,222489418,265374435,222460491,2429846,3077560,2611505,222451603,223694041,223667213],"pageRank":6.168111320365835E-4}
