{"id":258345759,"name":"Empirical risk minimization for heavy-tailed losses","abstraction":"Suppose $k$ centers are fit to $m$ points by heuristically minimizing the $k$-means cost; what is the corresponding fit over the source distribution? This question is resolved here for distributions with $p\\geq 4$ bounded moments; in particular, the difference between the sample cost and distribution cost decays with $m$ and $p$ as $m^{\\min\\{-1/4, -1/2+2/p\\}}$. The essential technical contribution is a mechanism to uniformly control deviations in the face of unbounded parameter sets, cost functions, and source distributions. To further demonstrate this mechanism, a soft clustering variant of $k$-means cost is also considered, namely the log likelihood of a Gaussian mixture, subject to the constraint that all covariance matrices have bounded spectrum. Lastly, a rate with refined constants is provided for $k$-means instances possessing some cluster structure.","authors":["Matus Telgarsky","Sanjoy Dasgupta"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263012371_Empirical_risk_minimization_for_heavy-tailed_losses"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358651_Strong_Consistency_of_K-Means_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2940184_Clustering_with_Bregman_Divergences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3078598_Rates_of_convergence_in_the_source_coding_theorem_empirical_quantizer_design_and_universal_lossy_source_coding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41712113_Theory_of_Classification_A_Survey_of_Some_Recent_Advances","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497545_A_Sober_Look_at_Clustering_Stability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46108483_On_the_rate_of_convergence_of_the_maximum_likelihood_estimator_of_a_k-monotone_density","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226020729_A_Framework_for_Statistical_Clustering_with_a_Constant_Time_Approximation_Algorithms_for_K-Median_Clustering"],"citedInIDs":[263012371],"refrenceIDs":[38358651,2940184,3078598,41712113,221497545,46108483,226020729],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
