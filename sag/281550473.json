{"id":281550473,"name":"Performance comparison of random number generators based on Adaptive Rejection Sampling","abstraction":"The adaptive rejection sampling (ARS) algorithm is a universal random generator for drawing samples efficiently from a univariate log-concave target probability density function (pdf). ARS generates independent samples from the target via rejection sampling with high acceptance rates. Indeed, ARS yields a sequence of proposal functions that converge toward the target pdf, so that the probability of accepting a sample approaches one. However, sampling from the proposal pdf becomes more computational demanding each time it is updated. In this work, we propose a novel ARS scheme, called Cheap Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), where the computational effort for drawing from the proposal remains constant, decided in advance by the user. For generating a large number of desired samples, CARS is faster than ARS.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265989489_Automatic_Nonuniform_Random_Variate_Generation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41222435_Monte_Carlo_Statistical_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910613_Adaptive_Rejection_Sampling_for_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245872004_Derivative-free_adaptive_rejection_sampling_for_Gibbs_sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275213053_Independent_Doubly_Adaptive_Rejection_Metropolis_Sampling_Within_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271624785_Random_Variable_Generation_Using_Concavity_Properties_of_Transformed_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233193155_Concave-Convex_Adaptive_Rejection_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286782_A_generalization_of_the_adaptive_rejection_sampling_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910614_Adaptive_Rejection_Metropolis_Sampling_Within_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255971684_Adaptive_Sticky_Generalized_Metropolis"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[265989489,41222435,224910613,245872004,275213053,271624785,233193155,220286782,224910614,255971684],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
