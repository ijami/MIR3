{"id":2462099,"name":"The Planning-ahead SMO Algorithm","abstraction":"This paper studies the convergence properties of a general class of decomposition algorithms for support vector machines (SVMs). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for stepwise improvement of these algorithms, and show how to modify existing algorithms to satisfy these conditions. We also give polynomial-time bounds on the number of iterations required for convergence of these algorithms. For example, we show that when the slack multiplier C satisfies p 1\u003d2 C mL, where m is the number of samples and L is the maximum norm of 2 by 2 matrices that are obtained from the Gram matrix Q by restricting to two indices, then it takes no more than 4LC 2 m 4 \u003dffl iterations to drive the criterion to within ffl of its optimum.
