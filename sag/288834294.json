{"id":288834294,"name":"A GUI platform for uncertainty quantification of complex dynamical models","abstraction":"A framework for optimization of wideband antennas including statistical reliability considerations is proposed. Using predetermined tolerances of the manufacturing process, the reliability analysis provides a failure probability of the considered antenna according to imposed specifications. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to quantify the relative weight of the antenna’s parameters on the variability of |S11|. On this basis, a reliability-aware definition of optimization parameters can be derived to minimize failure probability during fabrication. For demonstration, a particular type of antenna, namely the tapered half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW) leaky-wave antenna, is chosen for the reliability analysis and optimization. This antenna is optimized for operation in the band from 7 GHz to 14 GHz (with specification |S11| \u003c 􀀀10 dB) with a calculated failure probability of less than 1%. A fabrication of the designed prototype yields measurements showing a strict adherence to specifications, which exemplifies the relevance of the statistical analysis. The study can be generalized to any wideband antenna provided that a fast computation of cost function can be obtained.","authors":["Sébastien Lalléchère","Pierre Bonnet"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276916541_Characterizing_Physically_Transient_Antennas","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3130422_Adjoint_Techniques_for_Sensitivity_Analysis_in_High-Frequency_Structure_CAD","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265058957_Safety_assessment_of_a_transmission_line_with_EMC_requirements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3480763_Half_width_leaky_wave_antennas","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258792624_Microwave_Near-Field_Focusing_Properties_of_Width-Tapered_Microstrip_Leaky-Wave_Antenna","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270724858_An_Array_of_Half-Width_Microstrip_Leaky-Wave_Antennas_Radiating_on_Boresight","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262771939_A_Semi-Analytical_Solution_of_a_Tapered_Half-Mode_Substrate-Integrated_Waveguide_With_Application_to_Rapid_Antenna_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50996224_Handbook_of_Monte_Carlo_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261170642_Wideband_transition_from_coaxial_line_to_half-mode_substrate_integrated_waveguide","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3130710_Guide-wave_and_leakage_characteristics_of_substrate_integrated_waveguide"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[276916541,3130422,265058957,3480763,258792624,270724858,262771939,50996224,261170642,3130710],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
