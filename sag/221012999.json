{"id":221012999,"name":"Joint Space Neural Probabilistic Language Model for Statistical Machine Translation","abstraction":"We extend previous work on fully unsu- pervised part-of-speech tagging. Using a non-parametric version of the HMM, called the infinite HMM (iHMM), we ad- dress the problem of choosing the number of hidden states in unsupervised Markov models for PoS tagging. We experi- ment with two non-parametric priors, the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes, on the Wall Street Journal dataset using a paral- lelized implementation of an iHMM in- ference algorithm. We evaluate the re- sults with a variety of clustering evalua- tion metrics and achieve equivalent or bet- ter performances than previously reported. Building on this promising result we eval- uate the output of the unsupervised PoS tagger as a direct replacement for the out- put of a fully supervised PoS tagger for the task of shallow parsing and compare the two evaluations.","authors":["Jurgen Van Gael","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234131160_Joint_Space_Neural_Probabilistic_Language_Model_for_Statistical_MachineTranslation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230672506_Parallelization_of_Maximum_Entropy_POS_Tagging_for_Bahasa_Indonesia_withMapReduce","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224175402_Scaling_the_iHMM_Parallelization_versus_Hadoop"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251452566_Unsupervised_and_Constrained_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_for_Verb_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012656_V-Measure_A_Conditional_Entropy-Based_External_Cluster_Evaluation_Measure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873199_The_Infinite_Tree","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013249_The_infinite_PCFG_using_hierarchical_Dirichlet_processes_EMNLP","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228689556_Unsupervised_part-of-speech_tagging_supporting_supervised_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012831_Why_doesn%27t_EM_find_good_HMM_POS-taggers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013071_A_comparison_of_Bayesian_estimators_for_unsupervised_Hidden_Markov_Model_POS_taggers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874388_A_fully_Bayesian_approach_to_unsupervised_part-of-speech_tagging"],"citedInIDs":[234131160,230672506,224175402],"refrenceIDs":[220851866,251452566,221012656,220873199,221013249,221345210,228689556,221012831,221013071,220874388],"pageRank":8.353087751558569E-4}
