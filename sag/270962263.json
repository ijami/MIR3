{"id":270962263,"name":"Parallel Univariate Decision Trees","abstraction":"In this paper, we give and prove the lower bounds of the Vapnik--Chervonenkis (VC)-dimension of the univariate decision tree hypothesis class. The VC-dimension of the univariate decision tree depends on the VC-dimension values of its subtrees and the number of inputs. Via a search algorithm that calculates the VC-dimension of univariate decision trees exhaustively, we show that our VC-dimension bounds are tight for simple trees. To verify that the VC-dimension bounds are useful, we also use them to get VC-generalization bounds for complexity control using structural risk minimization in decision trees, i.e., pruning. Our simulation results show that structural risk minimization pruning using the VC-dimension bounds finds trees that are more accurate as those pruned using cross validation.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221997066_The_Nature_of_Satistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688794_C45_Programs_For_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3421651_Top-Down_Induction_of_Decision_Trees_Classifiers-A_Survey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2702628_Pessimistic_Decision_Tree_Pruning_Based_on_Tree_Size","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220114958_The_Vapnik-Chervonenkis_Dimension_of_Decision_Trees_with_Bounded_Rank","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274713745_On_the_VC-dimension_of_univariate_decision_trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221579361_Calculating_the_VC-dimension_of_decision_trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320196_Statistical_Comparisons_of_Classifiers_over_Multiple_Data_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244521691_UCI_Repository_of_Machine_Learning_Databases"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[221997066,220688794,226222944,3421651,2702628,220114958,274713745,221579361,220320196,244521691],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
