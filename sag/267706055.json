{"id":267706055,"name":"Hessian-Free Optimization For Learning Deep Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks","abstraction":"Variational methods have been previously explored as a tractable approximation to Bayesian inference for neural networks. However the approaches proposed so far have only been applicable to a few simple network architectures. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement stochastic variational method (or equivalently, minimum description length loss function) that can be applied to most neural net-works. Along the way it revisits several common regularisers from a variational perspective. It also provides a simple pruning heuristic that can both drastically re-duce the number of network weights and lead to improved generalisation. Exper-imental results are provided for a hierarchical multidimensional recurrent neural network applied to the TIMIT speech corpus.","authors":["Alex Graves"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281768642_Hessian-Free_Optimization_For_Learning_Deep_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959252_Bayesian_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Bernoulli_Approximate_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095632_Variational_Bayesian_Inference_with_Stochastic_Search"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280218_Keeping_Neural_Networks_Simple_by_Minimizing_the_Description_Length_of_the_Weights","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3593275_Pruning_recurrent_neural_networks_for_improved_generalization_performance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265368057_MacKay_DJC_Probable_networks_and_plausible_predictions_-_a_review_of_practical_Bayesian_methods_for_supervised_neural_networks_Network_Computation_in_Neural_Systems_6_469-505","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3175691_Speaker-independent_phone_recognition_using_hidden_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222812561_Modeling_By_Shortest_Data_Description","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499717_Simplifying_Neural_Networks_by_Soft_Weight-Sharing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3568712_A_Direct_Adaptive_Method_for_Faster_Backpropagation_Learning_The_RPROP_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346365_Connectionist_temporal_classification_Labelling_unsegmented_sequence_data_with_recurrent_neural_%27networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3303419_Variational_Learning_and_Bits-Back_Coding_An_Information-Theoretic_View_to_Bayesian_Learning"],"citedInIDs":[281768642,277959252,228095632],"refrenceIDs":[2280218,3593275,265368057,3175691,222812561,221620610,220499717,3568712,221346365,3303419],"pageRank":0.0013193614480424703}
