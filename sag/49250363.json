{"id":49250363,"name":"Big Data and Cross-Document Coreference Resolution: Current State and Future Opportunities","abstraction":"Although information extraction and coref- erence resolution appear together in many applications, most current systems perform them as independent steps. This paper describes an approach to integrated infer- ence for extraction and coreference based on conditionally-trained undirected graphical models. We discuss the advantages of condi- tional probability training, and of a corefer- ence model structure based on graph parti- tioning. On a data set of research paper cita- tions, we show significant reduction in error by using extraction uncertainty to improve coreference citation matching accuracy, and using coreference to improve the accuracy of the extracted fields.","authors":["Fuchun Peng"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258566747_Big_Data_and_Cross-Document_Coreference_Resolution_Current_State_and_Future_Opportunities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228333636_Piecewise_Training_for_Undirected_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268386079_Joint_Inference_a_Statistical_Approach_for_Open_Information_Extraction"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235080010_Autocorrelation_and_Relational_Learning_Challenges_and_Opportunities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234140148_Variational_Approximations_between_Mean_Field_Theory_and_the_JunctionTree_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900556_Early_Results_for_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Conditional_Random_Fields_Feature_Induction_and_Web-Enhanced_Lexicons","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233950933_On_the_Statistical-Analysis_of_Dirty_Pictures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228721051_Identity_uncertainty_and_citation_matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233871642_Efficiently_Inducing_Features_of_Conditional_Random_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2572259_A_Note_on_the_Unification_of_Information_Extraction_and_Data_Mining_using_Conditional-Probability_Relational_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2563617_Named_Entity_Extraction_using_AdaBoost","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2937674_A_Linear_Programming_Formulation_for_Global_Inference_in_Natural_Language_Tasks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242327919_Correlation_and_Clustering_Statistical_Properties_of_Galaxy_Large_Scale_Structures"],"citedInIDs":[258566747,228333636,268386079],"refrenceIDs":[235080010,234140148,2900556,233950933,228721051,233871642,2572259,2563617,2937674,242327919],"pageRank":0.001020314054631421}
