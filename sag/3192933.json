{"id":3192933,"name":"Probabilistic Programming with Gaussian Process Memoization","abstraction":"We consider the problem of assigning an input vector to one of m classes by predicting P(c|x) for c\u003d1,...,m. For a two-class problem, the probability of class one given x is estimated by σ(y(x)), where σ(y)\u003d1/(1+e-y). A Gaussian process prior is placed on y(x), and is combined with the training data to obtain predictions for new x points. We provide a Bayesian treatment, integrating over uncertainty in y and in the parameters that control the Gaussian process prior the necessary integration over y is carried out using Laplace\u0027s approximation. The method is generalized to multiclass problems (m\u003e2) using the softmax function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on a number of datasets","authors":["C.K.I.
