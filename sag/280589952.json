{"id":280589952,"name":"Exponential bounds for the distribution of the norm of sub-Gaussian random vectors","abstraction":"We establish exponential bounds for the hypergeometric distribution which include a finite sampling correction factor, but are otherwise analogous to bounds for the binomial distribution due to Le\\\u0027on and Perron (2003) and Talagrand (1994). We also establish a convex ordering for sampling without replacement from populations of real numbers between zero and one: a population of all zeros or ones (and hence yielding a hypergeometric distribution in the upper bound) gives the extreme case.","authors":["Evan Greene"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239061974_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_-_Volume_I_and_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223128265_Concentration_of_the_hypergeometric_distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357857_Inequalities_for_Symmetric_Sampling_Plans_I","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256644134_Moment_problems_for_sampling_without_replacement_III","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23634810_Extremal_properties_of_sums_of_Bernoulli_random_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357750_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_in_Sampling_without_Replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38360557_Sharper_Bounds_for_Gaussian_and_Empirical_Processes"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[256606492,239061974,221996154,223128265,38357857,256644134,23634810,38357750,38360557],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
