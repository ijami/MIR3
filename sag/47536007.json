{"id":47536007,"name":"Arratia flow with drift and the Trotter formula for Brownian web","abstraction":"We study the short-time asymptotical behavior of stochastic flows on \\mathbb{R} in the \\sup-norm. The results are stated in terms of a Gaussian process associated with the covariation of the flow. In case the Gaussian process has a continuous version the two processes can be coupled in such a way that the difference is uniformly $o(\\ln\\ln t^{-1})$. In case it has no continuous version, an $O(\\ln\\ln t^{-1})$ estimate is obtained under mild regularity assumptions. The main tools are Gaussian measure concentration and a martingale version of the Slepian comparison principle.
