{"id":256576045,"name":"A variational source method for numerical studies of field theory","abstraction":"We apply the recently suggested linear updating algorithm of Kennedy and Kuti to four-dimensional SU(3) bosonic gauge theory with the Wilson action. The change in the action for each link update is estimated stochastically, and we find that the algorithm gives the mean plaquette correctly for reasonable parameter values. Our results indicate that this method should be efficient for Monte Carlo computations with complicated â€œimprovedâ€? actions, and they also show the feasibility of using such â€œnoisyâ€? methods to include the dynamical effects of fermions.","authors":["G.
