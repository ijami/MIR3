{"id":221618661,"name":"Structural-RNN: Deep Learning on Spatio-Temporal Graphs","abstraction":"Discriminatively trained undirected graphical models have had wide empirical success, and there has been increasing interest in toolkits that ease their applica- tion to complex relational data. The power in relational models is in their repeated structure and tied parameters; at issue is how to define these structures in a pow- erful and flexible way. Rather than using a declarative language, such as SQL or first-order logic, we advocate using an imperative language to express various aspects of model structure, inference, and learning. By combining the traditional, declarative, statistical semantics of factor graphs with imperative definitions of their construction and operation, we allow the user to mix declarative and proce- dural domain knowledge, and also gain significant efficiencies. We have imple- mented such imperatively defined factor graphs in a system we call FACTORIE, a software library for an object-oriented, strongly-typed, functional language. In experimental comparisons to Markov Logic Networks on joint segmentation and coreference, we find our approach to be 3-15 times faster while reducing error by 20-25%â€”achieving a new state of the art.","authors":["Karl Schultz"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284219934_Structural-RNN_Deep_Learning_on_Spatio-Temporal_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233836083_Compiling_Relational_Database_Schemata_into_Probabilistic_GraphicalModels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252967947_Felix_Scaling_Inference_for_Markov_Logic_with_an_Operator-based_Approach"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262173992_The_Logic_of_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215990321_Tractable_Learning_and_Inference_with_High-Order_Representations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49250363_UAI_2004_WELLNER_ET_AL_593_An_Integrated_Conditional_Model_of_Information_Extraction_and_Coreference_with_Application_to_Citation_Matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6440627_Global_Discriminative_Learning_for_Higher-Accuracy_Computational_Gene_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220812296_PRISM_A_symbolic-statistical_modeling_language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223712920_Probabilistic_Horn_abduction_and_Bayesian_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220344023_Creating_Advice-Taking_Reinforcement_Learners","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30815019_BLOG_Probabilistic_Models_with_Unknown_Objects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618733_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Object_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220698781_Bi-directional_Joint_Inference_for_Entity_Resolution_and_Segmentation_Using_Imperatively-Defined_Factor_Graphs"],"citedInIDs":[284219934,233836083,252967947],"refrenceIDs":[262173992,215990321,49250363,6440627,220812296,223712920,220344023,30815019,221618733,220698781],"pageRank":9.908107192402116E-4}
