{"id":266856377,"name":"Beta-Negative Binomial Process and Exchangeable Random Partitions for Mixed-Membership Modeling","abstraction":"Motivated by the fundamental problem of measuring species diversity, this paper introduces the concept of a cluster structure to define an exchangeable cluster probability function that governs the joint distribution of a random count and its exchangeable random partitions. A cluster structure, naturally arising from a completely random measure mixed Poisson process, allows the probability distribution of the random partitions of a subset of a sample to be dependent on the sample size, a distinct and motivated feature that differs it from a partition structure. A generalized negative binomial process model is proposed to generate a cluster structure, where in the prior the number of clusters is finite and Poisson distributed, and the cluster sizes follow a truncated negative binomial distribution. We construct a nonparametric Bayesian estimator of Simpson\u0027s index of diversity under the generalized negative binomial process. We illustrate our results through the analysis of two real sequencing count datasets.","authors":["Mingyuan Zhou","Stephen G Walker"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267570378_Beta-Negative_Binomial_Process_and_Exchangeable_Random_Partitions_for_Mixed-Membership_Modeling"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257247082_Modeling_with_Normalized_Random_Measure_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349483_Generalized_Gamma_measures_and_shot-noise_Cox_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238745164_Estimating_the_Number_of_Species_A_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221672878_Bayesian_nonparametric_estimation_of_Simpson%27s_evenness_index_underalpha-Gibbs_priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235423956_Combinatorial_Methods_in_Discrete_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243082464_On_Species_Frequency_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18499361_Ewens_WJ_The_Sampling_Theory_of_Selectively_Neutral_Alleles_Theoret_Popul_Biol_3_87-112","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257299216_MCMC_for_Normalized_Random_Measure_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227652189_Bayesian_non-parametric_inference_for_species_variety_with_two-parameter_Poisson-Dirichlet_process_prior"],"citedInIDs":[267570378],"refrenceIDs":[38357862,257247082,38349483,238745164,221672878,235423956,243082464,18499361,257299216,227652189],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
