{"id":262348479,"name":"Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of a Parallel Boosting Algorithm","abstraction":"The scalability of machine learning (ML) algorithms has become a key issue as the size of training datasets continues to increase. To address this issue in a reasonably general way, a parallel boosting algorithm has been developed that combines concepts from spatially structured evolutionary algorithms (SSEAs) and ML boosting techniques. To get more insight into the algorithm, a proper theoretical and empirical analysis is required. This paper is a first step in that direction. First, it establishes the connection between this algorithm and well known density estimation and mixture model approaches used by the machine learning community. The paper then analyzes the algorithm in terms of varioustheoretical and empirical properties such as convergence to large margins, scalability effects on accuracy and speed, robustness to noise, and connections to support vector machines in terms of instances converged to.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280873163_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Analysis_of_a_Parallel_Boosting_Algorithm"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320803_LIBLINEAR_a_library_for_large_linear_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320025_Working_Set_Selection_Using_Second_Order_Information_for_Training_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346429_A_General_Method_for_Scaling_Up_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_and_its_Application_to_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221089387_On_the_Number_of_Modes_of_a_Gaussian_Mixture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215990408_The_weka_data_mining_software_an_update_SIGKDD_Explor_Newsl","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220701931_From_Recombination_of_Genes_to_the_Estimation_of_Distributions_I_Binary_Parameters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220701676_From_Recombination_of_Genes_to_the_Estimation_of_Distributions_II_Continuous_Parameters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996674_The_Infinite_Gaussian_Mixture_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259217788_Multivariate_inheritance_and_evolution_a_review_of_concepts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2570628_Exploiting_Unlabeled_Data_in_Ensemble_Methods"],"citedInIDs":[280873163],"refrenceIDs":[220320803,220320025,221346429,221089387,215990408,220701931,220701676,221996674,259217788,2570628],"pageRank":5.787435674664022E-4}
