{"id":15629049,"name":"Wei2010 Frontiers","abstraction":"On the basis of computational studies it has been proposed that the central nervous system internally simulates the dynamic behavior of the motor system in planning, control, and learning; the existence and use of such an internal model is still under debate. A sensorimotor integration task was investigated in which participants estimated the location of one of their hands at the end of movements made in the dark and under externally imposed forces. The temporal propagation of errors in this task was analyzed within the theoretical framework of optimal state estimation. These results provide direct support for the existence of an internal model.","authors":["D M Wolpert","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289254680_Wei2010_Frontiers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282362382_Reaching_with_the_sixth_sense_Vestibular_contributions_to_voluntary_motor_control_in_the_human_right_parietal_cortex","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284245342_Delayed_Visual_Feedback_of_One%27s_Own_Action_Promotes_Sense_of_Control_for_Auditory_Events"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19359466_A_model_of_the_smooth_pursuit_eye_movement_system_Biol_Cybern","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15908478_Toward_a_Modern_Theory_of_Adaptive_Networks_Expectation_and_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246939376_New_results_in_linear_prediction_filtering_theory_Trans_AMSE_J"],"citedInIDs":[289254680,282362382,284245342],"refrenceIDs":[19359466,15908478,246939376],"pageRank":6.068513488154751E-4}
