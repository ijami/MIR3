{"id":23978030,"name":"An MCMC approach for estimating a fluorescence lifetime with pile-up distortion","abstraction":"Bayesian inference for exponential mixtures is presented in the paper, including the choice of a non-informative prior based on a location-scale reparametrization of the mixture. Adapted control sheets are proposed for studying the convergence of the associated Gibbs sampler. They exhibit a strong lack of stability in the allocations of the observations to the different components of the mixture.","authors":["Robert Marie-Anne Gruet"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27612253_An_MCMC_approach_for_estimating_a_fluorescence_lifetime_with_pile-up_distortion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2763514_Computational_and_Inferential_Difficulties_With_Mixture_Posterior_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23524551_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Poisson_Mixtures"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4914136_Gibbs_Sampling_for_Bayesian_Non-Conjugate_and_Hierarchical_Models_by_Using_Auxiliary_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246736194_Methodes_de_Monte_Carlo_par_Chaines_de_Markov","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2348531_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixture_with_unknown_number_of_components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241228851_Tools_for_Statistical_Inference_Observed_Data_and_Data_Augmentation_Methods_Vol_67_of_Lecture_Notes_in_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227017011_Linking_Discrete_and_Continuous_Chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227104590_Simulation_of_right-_and_left-truncated_gamma_distribution_by_mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225959619_Reparameterization_strategies_for_hidden_Markov_models_and_Bayesian_approches_to_maximum_likelihood_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5066648_Testing_for_Mixtures_A_Bayesian_Entropic_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244419636_Bayesian_model_comparison_via_jump_diffusion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260161209_A_New_Graphical_Tool_to_Detect_Non-Normality"],"citedInIDs":[27612253,2763514,23524551],"refrenceIDs":[4914136,246736194,2348531,241228851,227017011,227104590,225959619,5066648,244419636,260161209],"pageRank":6.470931482051624E-4}
