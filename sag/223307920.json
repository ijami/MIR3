{"id":223307920,"name":"Reliability Assessment of Buckling for Stiffened Panels by Considering Localized Geometric Imperfections","abstraction":"A method is developed to successively find the multiple design points of a component reliability problem, when they exist on the limit-state surface. FORM or SORM approximations at each design point followed by a series system reliability analysis is shown to lead to improved estimates of the failure probability. Three example applications show the generality and robustness of the method.","authors":["Taleen Dakessian"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274312193_Reliability_Assessment_of_Buckling_for_Stiffened_Panels_by_Considering_Localized_Geometric_Imperfections","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255736695_The_Use_of_the_Direct_Optimized_Probabilistic_Calculation_Method_in_Design_of_Bolt_Reinforcement_for_Underground_and_Mining_Workings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259517885_Application_of_the_Direct_Optimized_Probabilistic_Calculation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265794417_Method_of_Structural_Safety","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263047733_Structural_Reliability_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688539_An_Introduction_to_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229644827_A_response_spectrum_method_for_random_vibration_analysis_for_MDOF_Systems"],"citedInIDs":[274312193,255736695,259517885],"refrenceIDs":[265794417,263047733,220688539,229644827],"pageRank":0.0012091630867903157}
