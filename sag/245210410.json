{"id":245210410,"name":"Reliability-based optimisation of offshore jacket-type structures with an integrated-algorithms system","abstraction":"A method for performing a reliability analysis of structural systems within a standard finite element code is presented. This numerical procedure can be implemented in any finite element (f.e.) code having an internal optimization routine. The design points of structural problems are determined by calculating the minimum distance from the origin to the failure surface in a set of normalized variables, by using the minimization routine of the f.e. code. In order to test the procedure, simple structural systems are solved and the results are compared with those obtained by using different approaches. Some examples of application of the procedure for the reliability analysis of real structures are presented.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233463597_Reliability-based_optimisation_of_offshore_jacket-type_structures_with_an_integrated-algorithms_system","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44029587_Parametric_uncertainties_in_reliability_analysis_of_bridge_structures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251109852_Redundancy_Analysis_of_Structural_Systems"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245211537_Direct_computation_of_the_design_point_of_a_stochastic_structure_using_a_finite_element_code","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245284547_A_Response_Surface_Approach_for_Reliability_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245285557_Hyperspace_Division_Method_for_Structural_Reliability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246192849_Finite_Element_Reliability_of_Geometrically_Nonlinear_Uncertain_Structures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239387028_Probability_Approximations_by_Log_Likelihood_Maximization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245302843_Reliability-Based_Vector_Optimization_of_Structural_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226241478_Response_variables_correlation_in_stochastic_finite_element_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265866099_Fragility_Analysis_of_Complex_Structural_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284294630_Galerkin_based_response_approach_for_reliability_analysis"],"citedInIDs":[233463597,44029587,251109852],"refrenceIDs":[245211537,245284547,245285557,246192849,239387028,245302843,226241478,265866099,284294630],"pageRank":6.559095324491686E-4}
