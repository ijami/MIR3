{"id":277959252,"name":"High-Order Stochastic Gradient Thermostats for Bayesian Learning of Deep Models","abstraction":"We present an efficient Bayesian convolutional neural network (convnet). The model offers better robustness to over-fitting on small data than traditional approaches. This is by placing a probability distribution over the convnet\u0027s kernels (also known as filters). We approximate the model\u0027s intractable posterior with Bernoulli variational distributions. This requires no additional model parameters. Our model can be implemented using existing tools in the field. This is by extending the recent interpretation of dropout as approximate inference in the Gaussian process to the case of Bayesian neural networks. The model achieves a considerable improvement in classification accuracy compared to previous approaches. We finish with state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10 following our new interpretation.","authors":["Yarin Gal","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288059688_High-Order_Stochastic_Gradient_Thermostats_for_Bayesian_Learning_of_Deep_Models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266248467_BAYESIAN_LEARNING_FOR_NEURAL_NETWORKS_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280218_Keeping_Neural_Networks_Simple_by_Minimizing_the_Description_Length_of_the_Weights","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243771025_Ensemble_learning_in_Bayesian_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267706055_Practical_Variational_Inference_for_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277022910_Weight_Uncertainty_in_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269996418_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning_Adaptive_Computation_and_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits"],"citedInIDs":[288059688],"refrenceIDs":[267960550,265787949,266248467,2280218,243771025,267706055,277022910,269996418,2985446,247931959],"pageRank":5.92249321052782E-4}
