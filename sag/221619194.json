{"id":221619194,"name":"A Nonparametric Bayesian Approach Toward Stacked Convolutional Independent Component Analysis","abstraction":"Abstract We introduce binary matrix factorization, a novel model for unsupervised matrix decomposition.,The decomposition,is learned by fitting a non-parametric Bayesian probabilistic model with binary latent variables to a matrix of dyadic data. Unlike bi-clustering models, which assign each row or column to a single cluster based on a categorical hidden feature, our binary fe ature model reflects the prior belief that items and attributes can be associated wit h more than one latent cluster at a time. We provide simple learning and inference r ules for this new model,and show how,to extend it to an infinite model,in which,the number,of features is not a priori fixed but is allowed to grow with the si ze of the data. 1 Distributed representations for dyadic data","authors":["Zoubin Ghahramani","Radford M.
