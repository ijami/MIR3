{"id":3175691,"name":"Progress on Phoneme Recognition with a Continuous-State HMM","abstraction":"Hidden Markov modeling is extended to speaker-independent phone recognition. Using multiple codebooks of various linear-predictive-coding (LPC) parameters and discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs) the authors obtain a speaker-independent phone recognition accuracy of 58.8-73.8% on the TIMIT database, depending on the type of acoustic and language models used. In comparison, the performance of expert spectrogram readers is only 69% without use of higher level knowledge. The authors introduce the co-occurrence smoothing algorithm, which enables accurate recognition even with very limited training data. Since the results were evaluated on a standard database, they can be used as benchmarks to evaluate future systems","authors":["K.-F. Lee","H.-W.
