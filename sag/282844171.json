With CAB we attempt to craft a bandit algorithm that can exploit collaborative effects and that can be deployed in a practical recommendation system setting, where the multi-armed bandits have been shown to perform well in particular with respect to the cold start problem. CAB exploits, a context-aware clustering technique augmenting exploration-exploitation strategies in a contextual multi-armed bandit settings. CAB dynamically clusters the users based on the content universe under consideration. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on extensive real-world datasets, showing the scalability, and more importantly, the significant increased prediction performance compared to related state-of-the-art methods.","authors":["Shuai Li"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230627940_Improved_Algorithms_for_Linear_Stochastic_Bandits_extended_version","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220151284_Exploration-exploitation_tradeoff_using_variance_estimates_in_multi-armed_bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320299_Using_Confidence_Bounds_for_Exploitation-Exploration_Trade-offs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252932456_Sequential_Transfer_in_Multi-armed_Bandit_with_Finite_Set_of_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268747847_A_Latent_Source_Model_for_Online_Collaborative_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069477_Sample_Complexity_of_Multi-task_Reinforcement_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220813304_Hybrid_Systems_for_Personalized_Recommendations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221520040_Large-Scale_Analysis_of_Individual_and_Task_Differences_in_Search_Result_Page_Examination_Strategies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262312622_Mixing_bandits_a_recipe_for_improved_cold-start_recommendations_in_a_social_network"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[230627940,220151284,220320299,220343796,252932456,268747847,257069477,220813304,221520040,262312622],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
