{"id":215470712,"name":"Posterior calibration and exploratory analysis for natural language processing models","abstraction":"We present an unsupervised, nonparametric Bayesian approach to coreference resolution which models both global entity identity across a corpus as well as the sequential anaphoric structure within each document. While most existing coreference work is driven by pairwise decisions, our model is fully generative, producing each mention from a combination of global entity properties and local attentional state. Despite being unsupervised, our system achieves a 70.3 MUC F 1 measure on the MUC-6 test set, broadly in the range of some recent supervised results.","authors":["Dan Klein"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281227494_Posterior_calibration_and_exploratory_analysis_for_natural_language_processing_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236127387_A_Controlled_Greedy_Supervised_Approach_for_Co-reference_Resolution_on_Clinical_Text","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270877265_Coreference_Clustering_using_Column_Generation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875038_A_Mention-Synchronous_Coreference_Resolution_Algorithm_Based_On_the_Bell_Tree","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817243_Joint_Determination_of_Anaphoricity_and_Coreference_Resolution_using_Integer_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220906965_A_Latent_Dirichlet_Model_for_Unsupervised_Entity_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239067001_Conditional_Models_of_Identity_Uncertainty_with_Application_to_Noun_Coreference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2527394_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Coreference_Resolution_of_Noun_Phrases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2906775_Improving_Machine_Learning_Approaches_to_Coreference_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220825492_A_model-theoretic_coreference_scoring_scheme","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2478019_A_Statistical_Approach_to_Anaphora_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30815019_BLOG_Probabilistic_Models_with_Unknown_Objects"],"citedInIDs":[281227494,236127387,270877265],"refrenceIDs":[220875038,220817243,4742259,220906965,239067001,2527394,2906775,220825492,2478019,30815019],"pageRank":0.0013768746355331998}
