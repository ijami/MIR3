{"id":243022957,"name":"Bounds for logarithmic Sobolev constants for Gaussian convolutions of compactly supported measures","abstraction":"Let G be a compact Lie group. Denote by m the Brownian bridge measure on the loop group Y ≡ {gϵC([0, 1]; G): g(0) \u003d g(1) \u003d e }. The finite energy subgroup of Y determines in a natural way a gradient operation for functions on Y. The following logarithmic Sobolev inequality is proven, denotes the L2(m) norm and V is a potential which is quadratic in the associated Lie algebra valued Brownian motion. The inequality is derived by a method of inheritance from the known inequality for the G valued Brownian motion.","authors":["Leonard Gross"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262264673_Bounds_for_logarithmic_Sobolev_constants_for_Gaussian_convolutions_of_compactly_supported_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256504421_Logarithmic_Sobolev_Trace_Inequalities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241701910_A_Survey_on_dynamical_transport_distances"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258505506_Geometric_Measure_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216637003_Stochastic_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255569754_Dirichlet_forms_on_loop_space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265327115_Dirichlet_Forms_and_Markov_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232332958_Existence_and_uniqueness_of_physical_ground_states","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266194561_Logarithmic_Sobolev_inequalities_for_the_heat_kernel_on_a_Lie_group","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243781824_Differential_Geometry_and_Symmetric_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256230386_Gaussian_measures_on_a_Banach_space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256231101_Integration_on_loop_groups_I_Quasi_invariant_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243114567_Absolute_continuity_of_probability_laws_of_Wiener_functionals"],"citedInIDs":[262264673,256504421,241701910],"refrenceIDs":[258505506,216637003,255569754,265327115,232332958,266194561,243781824,256230386,256231101,243114567],"pageRank":0.0013611307446597357}
