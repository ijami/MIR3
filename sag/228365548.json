{"id":228365548,"name":"Sequential Design of Computer Experiments for the Assessment of Fetus Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields","abstraction":"Computer simulation is often used to study complex physical and engineering processes. While a computer simulator can often be viewed as an inexpensive way to gain insight into a system, it can still be computationally costly. Much of the recent work on the design and anal-ysis of computer experiments has focused on scenarios where the goal is to fit a response surface or process optimization. In this article, we develop sequential methodology for estimating a contour from a complex computer code. The approach uses a stochastic process model as a surrogate for the computer simulator. The surrogate model and associated uncertainty are key components in a new criterion used to identify the computer trials aimed specifically at improv-ing the contour estimate. The proposed approach is applied to exploration of a contour for a network queuing system. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed approach are also addressed.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277977174_Sequential_Design_of_Computer_Experiments_for_the_Assessment_of_Fetus_Exposure_to_Electromagnetic_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262369166_KrigInv_An_efficient_and_user-friendly_implementation_of_batch-sequential_inversion_strategies_based_on_Kriging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241707670_Optimisation_of_interacting_particle_systems_for_rare_event_estimation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242380015_Practical_methoff_of_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222490346_Minimax_and_Maximin_Distance_Designs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216300613_Practical_Methods_of_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228572020_SELC_Sequential_Elimination_of_Level_Combinations_by_Means_of_Modified_Genetic_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247892177_The_global_optimization_problem_An_introduction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247903884_The_Implicit_Function_Modeling_System_-_Comparison_of_C_and_C_Solutions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227706203_Branch_and_bound_algorithm_for_computing_the_minimum_stability_degree_of_parameter-dependent_linear_systems_Int_J_Robust_Nonlinear_Control_1295-317","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349657_Queueing_and_scheduling_in_random_environments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235672371_Automated_Transformation_Invariant_Shape_Recognition_Through_Wavelet_Multiresolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242913395_Computing_Gaussian_Likelihoods_and_Their_Derivatives_for_General_Linear_Mixed_Models"],"citedInIDs":[277977174,262369166,241707670],"refrenceIDs":[242380015,222490346,216300613,228572020,247892177,247903884,227706203,38349657,235672371,242913395],"pageRank":7.458757403243109E-4}
