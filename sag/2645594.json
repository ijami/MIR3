{"id":2645594,"name":"Exploring dependence between categorical variables: Benefits and limitations of using variable selection within Bayesian clustering in relation to log-linear modelling with interaction terms","abstraction":"this article is generally to relate the DP based models and associated clustering methods to more explicit multinomial allocation variable approaches. By relating the MDP model to a special case of a simple and familiar parametric model for mixtures, we throw a different light on the claimed nonparametric nature of the MDP model. Distribution theory for this connection between model classes is explored in Section 2. In Section 3, we then investigate some of the statistical implications of DP models compared to the corresponding more flexible allocation variable approaches and illustrate these comparisons in a univariate mixture context. We show in particular that the unbalancedness of the allocation distribution which exists in the prior DP model persists a posteriori.","authors":["Peter J.
