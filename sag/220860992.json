{"id":220860992,"name":"Manifold Regularized Discriminative Neural Networks","abstraction":"Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure- dependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digit images.","authors":["David Steinkraus"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284218712_Manifold_Regularized_Discriminative_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284219941_Yin_and_Yang_Balancing_and_Answering_Binary_Visual_Questions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282981121_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_and_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Gender_Recognition"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256622653_Universal_Approximation_of_an_Unknown_Mapping_and_Its_Derivatives_Using_Multilayer_Feedforward_Networks_Neural_Net_3_551-560","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2553937_Mitigating_the_Paucity-of-Data_Problem_Exploring_the_Effect_of_Training_Corpus_Size_on_Classifier_Performance_for_Natural_Language_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2501352_Effective_Training_of_a_Neural_Network_Character_Classifier_for_Word_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3914211_An_offline_cursive_handwritten_word_recognition_system","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2403156_An_Improved_Recognition_Module_for_the_Identification_of_Handwritten_Digits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2924845_Training_Invariant_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE"],"citedInIDs":[284218712,284219941,282981121],"refrenceIDs":[256622653,247931959,2553937,215721451,2501352,3914211,2403156,2924845,2985446],"pageRank":7.02642496429573E-4}
