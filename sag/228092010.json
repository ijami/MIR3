{"id":228092010,"name":"A novel approach for Markov Random Field with intractable normalising constant on large lattices","abstraction":"Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are routinely used to draw samples from distributions with intractable normalization constants. However, standard MCMC algorithms do not apply to doubly-intractable distributions in which there are additional parameter-dependent normalization terms; for example, the posterior over parameters of an undirected graphical model. An ingenious auxiliary-variable scheme (Moeller et al., 2004) offers a solution: exact sampling (Propp and Wilson, 1996) is used to sample from a Metropolis-Hastings proposal for which the acceptance probability is tractable. Unfortunately the acceptance probability of these expensive updates can be low. This paper provides a generalization of Moeller et al. (2004) and a new MCMC algorithm, which obtains better acceptance probabilities for the same amount of exact sampling, and removes the need to estimate model parameters before sampling begins.","authors":["Iain Murray","Zoubin Ghahramani","David MacKay"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290263376_A_novel_approach_for_Markov_Random_Field_with_intractable_normalising_constant_on_large_lattices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283117669_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Density_Estimation_under_Length_Bias","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282639340_Bayesian_inference_for_misspecified_exponential_random_graph_models"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1820164_Exact_sampling_from_non-attractive_distributions_using_summary_states","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31403274_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_Using_Markov_Chains_and_Their_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2123628_Estimating_Ratios_of_Normalizing_Constants_Using_Linked_Importance_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764505_Bayesian_Model_Choice_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243775157_Simulating_Ratios_of_Normalizing_Constants_via_a_Simple_Identity_A_Theoretical_Exploration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220345500_Exact_sampling_with_couple_Markov_chains_and_applications_to_statistical_mechanics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2306327_Annealed_Importance_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224656674_Learning_algorithms_for_Boltzmann_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2777175_Sampling_from_Multimodal_Distributions_Using_Tempered_Transitions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157569_Bayesian_Learning_in_Undirected_Graphical_Models_Approximate_MCMCalgorithms"],"citedInIDs":[290263376,283117669,282639340],"refrenceIDs":[1820164,31403274,2123628,243764505,243775157,220345500,2306327,224656674,2777175,229157569],"pageRank":5.787435674664022E-4}
