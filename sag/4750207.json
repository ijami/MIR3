{"id":4750207,"name":"Computational Enhancements to Bayesian Design of Experiments Using Gaussian Processes","abstraction":"This article shows how a genetic algorithm can be used to find near-optimal Bayesian experimental designs for regression models. The design criterion considered is the expected Shannon information gain of the posterior distribution obtained from performing a given experiment compared with the prior distribution. Genetic algorithms are described and then applied to experimental designs. The methodology is then illustrated with a wide range of examples: linear and nonlinear regression, single and multiple factors, and normal and Bernoulli distributed experimental data.","authors":["Hamada M","H.
