{"id":230595972,"name":"Metaheuristic-based Heuristics for Symmetric-matrix Bandwidth Reduction: A Systematic Review","abstraction":"We present a linear-time algorithm for sparse symmetric matrices which converts a matrix into pentadiagonal form (\"bandwidth 2\"), whenever it is possible to do so using simultaneous row and column permutations. On the other hand when an arbitrary integer k and graphG are given, we show that it is NP-complete to determine whether or not there exists an ordering of the vertices such that the adjacency matrix has bandwidth -","authors":["Michael R Garey","R.
