{"id":236736803,"name":"Memory Constraint Online Multitask Classification","abstraction":"This contribution develops a theoretical framework that takes into ac- count the effect of approximate optimization on learning algorithms. The anal- ysis shows distinct tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. Small-scale learning problems are subject to the usual approximation- estimation tradeoff. Large-scale learning problems are subject to a qualitatively dif- ferent tradeoff involving the computational complexity of the underlying optimiza- tion algorithms in non-trivial ways. For instance, a mediocre optimization algo- rithms, stochastic gradient descent, is shown to perform very well on large-scale learning problems.","authors":["LÃ©on Bottou"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231512950_Memory_Constraint_Online_Multitask_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266525095_Statistical_Tests_for_Optimization_Efficiency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267940836_Fast_Online_Incremental_Attribute-based_Object_Classification_using_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_and_Self-_Organizing_Incremental_Neural_Network"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500215_Measuring_the_VC-Dimension_of_a_Learning_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2560520_Statistical_Behavior_and_Consistency_of_Classification_Methods_based_on_Convex_Risk_Minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060748_Concentration_inequalities_and_empirical_processes_theory_applied_to_the_analysis_of_learning_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2811922_Efficient_BackProp","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2852039_A_Few_Notes_on_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320717_QP_Algorithms_with_Guaranteed_Accuracy_and_Run_Time_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49940388_Convexity_classification_and_risk_bounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_time","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3087002_Correction_to_The_Importance_of_Convexity_in_Learning_With_Squared_Loss_Sep_98_1974-1980","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222625567_On_the_complexity_of_loading_shallow_neural_networks"],"citedInIDs":[231512950,266525095,267940836],"refrenceIDs":[220500215,2560520,239060748,2811922,2852039,220320717,49940388,221653970,3087002,222625567],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
