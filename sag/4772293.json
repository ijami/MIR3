{"id":4772293,"name":"Bayesian Inference for Non Linear Stochastic SIR Epidemic Model","abstraction":"The objective of the paper is to present a novel methodology for likelihood-based inference for discretely observed diffusions. We propose Monte Carlo methods, which build on recent advances on the exact simulation of diffusions, for performing maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation.
