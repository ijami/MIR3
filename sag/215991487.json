{"id":215991487,"name":"Holistic Entity Matching Across Knowledge Graphs","abstraction":"Entity resolution is the problem of determining which records in a database refer to the same entities, and is a crucial and expensive step in the data mining process. In- terest in it has grown rapidly in recent years, and many ap- proaches have been proposed. However, they tend to ad- dress only isolated aspects of the problem, and are often ad hoc. This paper proposes a well-founded, integrated solution to the entity resolution problem based on Markov logic. Markov logic combines first-order logic and proba- bilistic graphical models by attaching weights to first-order formulas, and viewing them as templates for features of Markov networks. We show how a number of previous ap- proaches can be formulated and seamlessly combined in Markov logic, and how the resulting learning and inference problems can be solved efficiently. Experiments on two ci- tation databases show the utility of this approach, and eval- uate the contribution of the different components.","authors":["Parag Singla","Pedro Domingos"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286457345_Holistic_Entity_Matching_Across_Knowledge_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281670250_Performance_Bounds_for_Pairwise_Entity_Resolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273157976_A_Review_of_Relational_Machine_Learning_for_Knowledge_Graphs_From_Multi-Relational_Link_Prediction_to_Automated_Knowledge_Graph_Construction"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220690917_Logical_Foundations_of_Artificial_Intelligence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9161126_Automatic_linkage_of_vital_records","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2481223_On_Evaluation_and_Training-Set_Construction_for_Duplicate_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221214854_The_MergePurge_Problem_for_Large_Databases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220283347_Using_q-grams_in_a_DBMS_for_Approximate_String_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653737_A_hit-miss_model_for_duplicate_detection_in_the_WHO_drug_safety_database","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221214100_Reference_Reconciliation_in_Complex_Information_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30815019_BLOG_Probabilistic_Models_with_Unknown_Objects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228915718_Establishing_identity_equivalence_in_multi-relational_domains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2565736_Learning_Domain-Independent_String_Transformation_Weights_for_High_Accuracy_Object_Identification"],"citedInIDs":[286457345,281670250,273157976],"refrenceIDs":[220690917,9161126,2481223,221214854,220283347,221653737,221214100,30815019,228915718,2565736],"pageRank":8.169874974900829E-4}
