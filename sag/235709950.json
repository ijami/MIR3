{"id":235709950,"name":"Subsampling-Based Approximate Monte Carlo for Discrete Distributions","abstraction":"In this paper sequential procedures are given for selecting the normal population with the greatest mean when (a) the $k$ populations have a common known variance or (b) the $k$ populations have a common but unknown variance, so that in each case the probability of making the correct selection exceeds a specified value when the greatest mean exceeds all other means by at least a specified amount. The procedures in the present paper all have the property that inferior populations can be eliminated from further consideration as the experiment proceeds.","authors":["Edward Paulson"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279633530_Subsampling-Based_Approximate_Monte_Carlo_for_Discrete_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259478458_lil%27_UCB_An_Optimal_Exploration_Algorithm_for_Multi-Armed_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265830785_Sequential_methods_for_comparative_effectiveness_experiments_Point_of_care_clinical_trials"],"refrenceUrls":[],"citedInIDs":[279633530,259478458,265830785],"refrenceIDs":[],"pageRank":6.084591538544757E-4}
