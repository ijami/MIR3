{"id":221344945,"name":"Learning Probabilistic Relational Models using co-clustering methods","abstraction":"Most real-world data is stored in relational form. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work with \"flat\" data representations, forcing us to convert our data into a form that loses much of the relational struc- ture. The recently introduced framework of proba- bilistic relational models (PRMs) allows us to repre- sent probabilistic models over multiple entities that utilize the relations between them. In this paper, we propose the use of probabilistic models not only for the attributes in a relational model, but for the rela- tional structure itself. We propose two mechanisms for modeling structural uncertainty: reference uncertainty and existence uncertainty. We describe the appropriate conditions for using each model and present learning algorithms for each. We present experimental results showing that the learned models can be used to pre- dict relational structure and, moreover, the observed relational structure can be used to provide better pre- dictions for the attributes in the model.","authors":["Nir Friedman","Daphne Koller","Benjamin Taskar"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278797816_Learning_Probabilistic_Relational_Models_using_co-clustering_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228934909_Propositional_and_relational_Bayesian_networks_associated_with_imprecise_and_qualitative_probabilistic_assessments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228594520_On_the_Problem_of_Reconstructing_an_Unknown_Topology_via_Locality_Properties_of_the_Wiener_Filter"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2630866_Discovering_Test_Set_Regularities_in_Relational_Domains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2431092_Automating_the_Construction_of_Internet_Portals_with_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223712920_Probabilistic_Horn_abduction_and_Bayesian_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220694524_Inductive_Logic_Programming_Techniques_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221644656_Inductive_Logic_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2374660_The_Missing_Link_-_A_Probabilistic_Model_of_Document_Content_and_Hypertext_Connectivity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225395207_Learning_Probabilistic_Relational_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2417508_Probabilistic_Frame-Based_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2358055_ATutorial_on_Learning_With_Bayesian_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2408220_A_Comparison_of_Event_Models_for_Naive_Bayes_Text_Classification"],"citedInIDs":[278797816,228934909,228594520],"refrenceIDs":[2630866,2431092,223712920,220694524,221644656,2374660,225395207,2417508,2358055,2408220],"pageRank":6.299832703772811E-4}
