{"id":230812882,"name":"Sleep and the Price of Plasticity: From Synaptic and Cellular Homeostasis to Memory Consolidation and Integration","abstraction":"Neurons deep in cortex interact with the environment extremely indirectly; the spikes they receive and produce are pre- and post-processed by millions of other neurons. This paper proposes two information-theoretic constraints guiding the production of spikes, that help ensure bursting activity deep in cortex relates meaningfully to events in the environment. First, neurons should emphasize selective responses with bursts. Second, neurons should propagate selective inputs by burst-firing in response to them. We show the constraints are necessary for bursts to dominate information-transfer within cortex, thereby providing a substrate allowing neurons to distribute credit amongst themselves. Finally, since synaptic plasticity degrades the ability of neurons to burst selectively, we argue that homeostatic regulation of synaptic weights is necessary, and that it is best performed offline during sleep.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259697580_Sleep_and_the_Price_of_Plasticity_From_Synaptic_and_Cellular_Homeostasis_to_Memory_Consolidation_and_Integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258037274_Sleep-Dependent_Synaptic_Down-Selection_II_Single-Neuron_Level_Benefits_for_Matching_Selectivity_and_Specificity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258056688_Sleep-Dependent_Synaptic_Down-Selection_I_Modeling_the_Benefits_of_Sleep_on_Memory_Consolidation_and_Integration"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6529815_Plenz_D_Thiagarajan_T_C_The_organizing_principles_of_neuronal_avalanches_cell_assemblies_in_the_cortex_Trends_Neurosci_30_101-110","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15439322_Rolls_E_T_Tovee_M_J_Sparseness_of_the_neuronal_representation_of_stimuli_in_the_primate_temporal_visual_cortex_J_Neurophysiol_73_713-726","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11669073_Cortical_Development_and_Remapping_through_Spike_Timing-Dependent_Plasticity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6968984_Spike_Timing-Dependent_Plasticity_From_Synapse_to_Perception","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8948349_Learning_in_Spiking_Neural_Networks_by_Reinforcement_of_Stochastic_Synaptic_Transmission","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6737725_Ma_WJ_et_al_Bayesian_inference_with_probabilistic_population_codes_Nat_Neurosci_9_1432-1438","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5577361_Spike_Timing-Dependent_Plasticity_A_Hebbian_Learning_Rule","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51436917_Darwin%27s_Strange_Inversion_of_Reasoning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12006609_Some_considerations_on_sleep_and_neural_plasticity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26645691_Dendritic_Spine_Dynamics"],"citedInIDs":[259697580,258037274,258056688],"refrenceIDs":[6529815,15439322,11669073,6968984,8948349,6737725,5577361,51436917,12006609,26645691],"pageRank":6.165596775082664E-4}
