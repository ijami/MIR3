{"id":230837892,"name":"Analysis of Anisotropic Brownian Textures and Application to Lesion Detection in Mammograms","abstraction":"The intrinsic random functions (IRF) are a particular case of the Guelfand generalized processes with stationary increments. They constitute a much wider class than the stationary RF, and are used in practical applications for representing non-stationary phenomena. The most important topics considered are: existence of a generalized covariance (GC) for which statistical inference is possible from a unique realization; theory of the best linear intrinsic estimator (BLIE) used for contouring and estimating problems; the turning bands method for simulating IRF; and the models with polynomial GC, for which statistical inference may be performed by automatic procedures.","authors":["Georges Matheron"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282898750_Analysis_of_Anisotropic_Brownian_Textures_and_Application_to_Lesion_Detection_in_Mammograms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284698663_huang_zhang_robeson_IRF_circle_2016","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282850545_Comparison_of_surrogate_models_for_time-variant_reliability_analysis"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269681721_Stationary_and_Related_Stochastic_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228057717_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240338872_The_Theory_of_Regionalized_Variables_and_Its_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243782736_The_Prediction_Theory_of_Multivariate_Stochastic_Processes_II-The_Linear_Predictor"],"citedInIDs":[282898750,284698663,282850545],"refrenceIDs":[269681721,228057717,240338872,243782736],"pageRank":0.001080532632208713}
