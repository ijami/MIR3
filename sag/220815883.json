{"id":220815883,"name":"Collapsed Variational Bayes Inference of Infinite Relational Model","abstraction":"Nonparametric Bayesian mixture models, in partic- ular Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models, have shown great promise for density estimation and data clustering. Given the size of today\u0027s datasets, computational efficiency becomes an essential in- gredient in the applicability of these techniques to real world data. We study and experimentally com- pare a number of variational Bayesian (VB) ap- proximations to the DP mixture model. In partic- ular we consider the standard VB approximation where parameters are assumed to be independent from cluster assignment variables, and a novel col- lapsed VB approximation where mixture weights are marginalized out. For both VB approximations we consider two different ways to approximate the DP, by truncating the stick-breaking construction, and by using a finite mixture model with a sym- metric Dirichlet prior.","authors":["Kenichi Kurihara","Max Welling","Yee Whye Teh"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787924_Collapsed_Variational_Bayes_Inference_of_Infinite_Relational_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236864431_Quantum_Annealing_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_with_Applications_to_Network_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275652699_Advances_in_Combining_Generalizability_Theory_and_Item_Response_Theory"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620110_A_Collapsed_Variational_Bayesian_Inference_Algorithm_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270121_A_Variational_Baysian_Framework_for_Graphical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2360305_Very_Fast_EM-based_Mixture_Model_Cluster_using_Multiresolution_kd-trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27290603_Gibbs_Sampling_Methods_for_Stick_-_breaking_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2281698_Variational_Inference_for_Bayesian_Mixture_of_Factor_Analysers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881800_Variational_Bayes_for_d-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3832184_Learning_mixture_of_Gaussians","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221404891_Gibbs_Sampling_for_Coupled_Infinite_Mixture_Models_in_the_Stick_Breaking_Representation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221146965_Dirichlet_Enhanced_Latent_Semantic_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227688851_Exact_and_Approximate_Sum_Representations_for_the_Dirichlet_process"],"citedInIDs":[265787924,236864431,275652699],"refrenceIDs":[221620110,220270121,2360305,27290603,2281698,224881800,3832184,221404891,221146965,227688851],"pageRank":6.822292677168824E-4}
