{"id":222018937,"name":"Efficient Probabilistic Classification Vector Machine With Incremental Basis Function Selection","abstraction":"We present a new method for the numerical simulation of lattice field theory. A hybrid (molecular dynamics/Langevin) algorithm is used to guide a Monte Carlo simulation. There are no discretization errors even for large step sizes. The method is especially efficient for systems such as quantum chromodynamics which contain fermionic degrees of freedom. Detailed results are presented for four-dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics including the dynamical effects of electrons.","authors":["A.D. Kennedy","Brian J.
