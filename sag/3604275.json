{"id":3604275,"name":"Interleaver Design for Turbo Codes","abstraction":"A new class of convolutional codes called turbo-codes, whose performances in terms of bit error rate (BER) are close to the Shannon limit, is discussed. The turbo-code encoder is built using a parallel concatenation of two recursive systematic convolutional codes, and the associated decoder, using a feedback decoding rule, is implemented as P pipelined identical elementary decoders","authors":["Alain Glavieux","Punya Thitimajshima"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242381066_Interleaver_Design_for_Turbo_Codes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280033867_Joint_Sparse_Channel_Estimation_and_Decoding_Continuous_and_Discrete_Domain_Sparsity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271723315_Iterative_Hyperspectral_Image_Classification_Using_Spectral-Spatial_Relational_Features"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3604225_A_Low_Complexity_Soft-Output_Viterbi_Decoder_Architecture"],"citedInIDs":[242381066,280033867,271723315],"refrenceIDs":[3604225],"pageRank":0.0016788904316354684}
