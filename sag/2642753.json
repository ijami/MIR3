{"id":2642753,"name":"Extracting the Classification Rules from General Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network","abstraction":"In this paper we present an average-case analysis of the Bayesian classifier, a simple probabilistic induction algorithm that fares remarkably well on many learning tasks. Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, Boolean attributes that are independent of each other and that follow a single distribution, and the absence of attribute noise. We first calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions; we then use this expression to compute the probability of correct classification over the space of instances. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of relevant and irrelevant attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. In addition, we explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for a number of artificial domains. We also give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning. Finally, we ...","authors":["Pat Langley"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282055098_Extracting_the_Classification_Rules_from_General_Fuzzy_Min-Max_Neural_Network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266627160_Elucidation_of_Pathways_Driving_Asthma_Pathogenesis_Development_of_a_Systems-Level_Analytic_Strategy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265594736_Performance_Evaluation_of_the_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_Used_in_Inference_Mechanism_of_a_Medical_Decision_Support_System"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2633357_Concept_Formation_in_Structured_Domains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220344164_Knowledge_Acquisition_Via_Incremental_Conceptual_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226192677_The_CN2_Induction_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226222944_Induction_of_Decision_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343611_Learning_From_Noisy_Examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343979_Empirical_Learning_as_a_Function_of_Concept_Character","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2394944_Induction_of_One-Level_Decision_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221405324_A_Bayesian_Method_for_Constructing_Bayesian_Belief_Networks_for_Databases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221606259_Probably_Approximately_Correct_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2627062_Calculation_of_the_Learning_Curve_of_Bayes_Optimal_Classification_Algorithm_for_Learning_a_Perceptron_With_Noise"],"citedInIDs":[282055098,266627160,265594736],"refrenceIDs":[2633357,220344164,226192677,226222944,220343611,220343979,2394944,221405324,221606259,2627062],"pageRank":0.0010673227891346585}
