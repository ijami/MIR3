{"id":246427191,"name":"Relative magnitude of cohort, age, and year effects on size at age of exploited marine fishes","abstraction":"We use simulation studies (a) to compare Bayesian and likelihood fitting methods, in terms of validity of conclusions, in two-level random-slopes regression (RSR) models, and (b) to compare several Bayesian estimation methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in terms of computational efficiency, in random-effects logistic regression (RELR) models. We find (a) that the Bayesian approach with a particular choice of diffuse inverse Wishart prior distribution for the (co)variance parameters performs at least as well-in terms of bias of estimates and actual coverage of nominal 95% intervals-as maximum likelihood methods in RSR models with medium sample sizes (expressed in terms of the number J of level-2 units), but neither approach performs as well as might be hoped wit small J; and (b) that an adaptive hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling method we have developed for use in the multilevel modeling package MlwiN outperforms adaptive rejection Gibbs sampling in the RELR models we have considered, sometimes by a wide margin.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280266537_Relative_magnitude_of_cohort_age_and_year_effects_on_size_at_age_of_exploited_marine_fishes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225821870_Statistical_Modelling_of_Neighbor_Treatment_Effects_in_Aquaculture_Clinical_Trials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49853922_A_Bayesian_model_for_repeated_measures_zero-inflated_count_data_with_application_to_outpatient_psychiatric_service_use"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2501030_A_comparison_of_Bayesian_and_likelihood-based_methods_for_fitting_multilevel_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265423254_Approximate_Inference_In_Generalized_Linear_Mixed_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910613_Adaptive_Rejection_Sampling_for_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363224_Inference_From_Iterative_Simulation_Using_Multiple_Sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246048559_Eliciting_prior_information_to_enhance_the_predictive_performance_of_Bayesian_graphical_models"],"citedInIDs":[280266537,225821870,49853922],"refrenceIDs":[2501030,265423254,224910613,38363224,246048559],"pageRank":6.266027830853326E-4}
