{"id":2349484,"name":"ASAGA: An adaptive surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm","abstraction":"In this paper we describe a method for improving genetic-algorithm-based optimization using search control. The idea is to utilize the sequence of points explored during a search to guide further exploration. The proposed method is particularly suitable for continuous spaces with expensive evaluation functions, such as arise in engineering design. Empirical results in several engineering design domains demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the e#ciency and reliability of the GA optimizer. Keywords: genetic algorithms, design optimization, machine learning To appear in Artificial Intelligence in Engineering, Design, Analysis and Manufacturing 1 Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [ Goldberg 1989 ] are search algorithms that simulate the process of natural selection. GAs attempt to find a good solution to some problem (e.g., finding the maximum of a function) by randomly generating a collection (\"population \") of potential solutions (\"individuals\") to t...","authors":["Haym Hirsh"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220741321_ASAGA_An_adaptive_surrogate-assisted_genetic_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4201485_Complementary_selection_and_variation_for_an_efficient_multiobjective_optimization_of_complex_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220858754_Data_Driven_Design_Optimization_Methodology_A_Dynamic_Data_Driven_Application_System"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30870312_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Search_Optimization_and_Machine_Learning_Addison-Wesley_Boston_MA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2261304_Gado_A_Genetic_Algorithm_For_Continuous_Design_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222501755_A_genetic_algorithm_for_continuous_design_space_search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343557_Chunking_in_Soar_The_Anatomy_of_a_General_Learning_Mechanism","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345340_An_Advanced_Evolution_Should_Not_Repeat_its_Past_Errors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2485857_Genetic_Algorithms_for_Real_Parameter_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2336982_High_Performance_Supersonic_Missile_Inlet_Design_Using_Automated_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30873058_Genetic_Data_Structures_Evolution_Programs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221603472_PROLEARN_Towards_a_Prolog_Interpreter_that_Learns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976281_Using_Genetic_Algorithms_in_Engineering_Design_Optimization_with_Non-Linear_Constraints"],"citedInIDs":[220741321,4201485,220858754],"refrenceIDs":[30870312,2261304,222501755,220343557,221345340,2485857,2336982,30873058,221603472,201976281],"pageRank":0.0011924868703154761}
