{"id":200622065,"name":"hazelton-lee-polak-1996","abstraction":"A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.","authors":["Metropolis NS","AW Rosenbluth","M. N. Rosenbluth","AH Teller","E. J.
