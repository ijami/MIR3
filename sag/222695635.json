{"id":222695635,"name":"Bayesian Analysis of the Scatterometer Wind Retrieval Inverse Problem","abstraction":"A conventional neural network approach to regression problems approximates the conditional mean of the output vector. For mappings which are multi-valued this approach breaks down, since the average of two solutions is not necessarily a valid solution. In this article mixture density networks, a principled method for modelling conditional probability density functions, are applied to retrieving Cartesian wind vector components from satellite scatterometer data. A hybrid mixture density network is implemented to incorporate prior knowledge of the predominantly bimodal function branches. An advantage of a fully probabilistic model is that more sophisticated and principled methods can be used to resolve ambiguities.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227606382_Bayesian_Analysis_of_the_Scatterometer_Wind_Retrieval_Inverse_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222536347_Bayesian_inference_for_wind_field_retrieval","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498303_Multi-valued_control_problems_and_mixture_density_network"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100226_Mixture_Models_Inference_and_Applications_to_Clustering_Dekker_New_York","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3490776_Identifiability_In_Wind_Estimation_From_Scatterometer_Measurements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215722315_Scatterometer_data_interpretation_Derivation_of_the_transfer_function_CMOD4","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215722314_Scatterometer_Data_Interpretation_Measurement_Space_and_Inversion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248794518_A_neural_network_approach_for_modeling_nonlinear_transfer_functions_Application_for_wind_retrieval_from_spaceborne_scatterometer_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3625294_Modelling_conditional_probability_distributions_for_periodic_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222548306_Neural_network_wind_retrieval_from_ERS-1_scatterometer_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498323_Neural_Network_Based_Wind_Vector_Retrieval_from_Satellite_Scatterometer_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248798881_Error_modeling_and_calibration_Towards_the_true_surface_wind_speed","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222555704_A_scatterometer_neural_network_sensor_model_with_input_noise"],"citedInIDs":[227606382,222536347,40498303],"refrenceIDs":[229100226,3490776,215722315,215722314,248794518,3625294,222548306,40498323,248798881,222555704],"pageRank":6.86312875746751E-4}
