{"id":1760118,"name":"Residual Weighted Learning for Estimating Individualized Treatment Rules","abstraction":"For binary classification we establish learning rates up to the order of $n^{-1}$ for support vector machines (SVMs) with hinge loss and Gaussian RBF kernels. These rates are in terms of two assumptions on the considered distributions: Tsybakov\u0027s noise assumption to establish a small estimation error, and a new geometric noise condition which is used to bound the approximation error. Unlike previously proposed concepts for bounding the approximation error, the geometric noise assumption does not employ any smoothness assumption.","authors":["Clint Scovel"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280969844_Residual_Weighted_Learning_for_Estimating_Individualized_Treatment_Rules","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388373_Model_selection_of_polynomial_kernel_regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264708667_Learning_From_Non-iid_Data_Fast_Rates_for_the_One-vs-All_Multiclass_Plug-in_Classifiers"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060260_Probability_in_Banach_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2560520_Statistical_Behavior_and_Consistency_of_Classification_Methods_based_on_Convex_Risk_Minimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225670544_Inegalites_de_concentration_pour_les_processus_empiriques_de_classes_de_parties","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320551_Sparseness_of_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080728_Improving_the_sample_complexity_using_global_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38351334_About_the_constants_in_talagrand%27s_concentration_inequalities_for_empirical_processes_Ann_Probab_282863-884_English_summary","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2291386_Smooth_Discrimination_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230675276_A_Probablistic_Theory_of_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2866564_Local_Rademacher_Complexities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2397693_A_Bennett_Concentration_Inequality_and_Its_Application_to_Suprema_of_Empirical_Processes"],"citedInIDs":[280969844,273388373,264708667],"refrenceIDs":[239060260,2560520,225670544,220320551,3080728,38351334,2291386,230675276,2866564,2397693],"pageRank":0.0013401632636371307}
