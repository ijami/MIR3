{"id":2334424,"name":"K-meansâ?Ž: Clustering by gradual data transformation","abstraction":"In [6] a cluster algorithm for graphs was introduced called the Markov cluster algorithm or MCL algorithm. The algorithm is based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs by means of alternation of two operators, expansion and inflation. The results in [8] establish an intrinsic relationship between the corresponding algebraic process (MCL process) and cluster structure in the iterands and the limits of the process. Several kinds of experiments conducted with the MCL algorithm are described here. Test cases with varying homogeneity characteristics are used to establish some of the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm. In general the algorithm performs well, except for graphs which are very homogeneous (such as weakly connected grids) and for which the natural cluster diameter (i.e. the diameter of a subgraph induced by a natural cluster) is large. This can be understood in terms of the flow characteristics of the MCL algorithm and the heuristic on which the...","authors":["Copyright Stichting","Mathematisch Centrum","Stijn Van Dongen"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263012833_K-means_Clustering_by_gradual_data_transformation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095677_A_Split-Merge_Framework_for_Comparing_Clusterings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51394419_Robustness_of_community_structure_networks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235961409_Cluster_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2261858_A_Computational_Study_of_Graph_Partitioning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262324026_Tree-Tree_Matrices_and_Other_Combinatorial_Problems_from_Taxonomy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27685884_Graph_Clustering_by_Flow_Simulation"],"citedInIDs":[263012833,228095677,51394419],"refrenceIDs":[235961409,2261858,262324026,27685884],"pageRank":6.15671781688976E-4}
