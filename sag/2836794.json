{"id":2836794,"name":"Iterative Ensemble Smoothers in the Annealed Importance Sampling Framework","abstraction":"This paper shows that importance sampling can be iterated to produce more accurate approximations to iid sampling from a target distribution, than sequential sampling from an MCMC algorithm. We first illustrate the adaptability of the joint scheme on a toy mixture example. As a more realistic example, we then reanalyse the ion channel model of Hodgson (1999), using an importance sampling scheme based on a hidden Markov representation. The degeneracy phenomenon that usually occurs in particle systems is studied on both examples","authors":["Jean-Michel Marin","Christian P.
