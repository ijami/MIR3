{"id":221603575,"name":"Exploiting Determinism to Scale Relational Inference","abstraction":"Many real-world problems are characterized by complex rela- tional structure, which can be succinctly represented in fir st- order logic. However, many relational inference algorithms proceed by first fully instantiating the first-order theory a nd then working at the propositional level. The applicability of such approaches is severely limited by the exponential time and memory cost of propositionalization. Singla and Domin- gos (2006) addressed this by developing a \"lazy\" version of the WalkSAT algorithm, which grounds atoms and clauses only as needed. In this paper we generalize their ideas to a much broader class of algorithms, including other types of SAT solvers and probabilistic inference methods like MCMC. Lazy inference is potentially applicable whenever variables and functions have default values (i.e., a value that is much more frequent than the others). In relational domains, the default is false for atoms and true for clauses. We illustrat e our framework by applying it to MC-SAT, a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Experiments on a number of real-world domains show that lazy inference reduces both space and time by several orders of magnitude, making probabilistic rela- tional inference applicable in previously infeasible domains.","authors":["Hoifung Poon","Pedro Domingos","Marc Sumner"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275346233_Exploiting_Determinism_to_Scale_Relational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261040911_Learning_to_Refine_an_Automatically_Extracted_Knowledge_Base_Using_Markov_Logic","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653537_Web_information_extraction_using_Markov_logic_networks"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220690917_Logical_Foundations_of_Artificial_Intelligence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092011_General-Purpose_MCMC_Inference_over_Relational_Structures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247752095_The_Alchemy_system_for_statistical_relational_AI","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344945_Learning_Probabilistic_Models_of_Relational_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221606462_MPE_and_Partial_Inversion_in_Lifted_Probabilistic_Variable_Elimination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215990907_Markov_Logic_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4914136_Gibbs_Sampling_for_Bayesian_Non-Conjugate_and_Hierarchical_Models_by_Using_Auxiliary_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221604167_Memory-Efficient_Inference_in_Relational_Domains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221604622_Joint_Inference_in_Information_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221605263_Sound_and_Efficient_Inference_with_Probabilistic_and_Deterministic_Dependencies"],"citedInIDs":[275346233,261040911,221653537],"refrenceIDs":[220690917,228092011,247752095,221344945,221606462,215990907,4914136,221604167,221604622,221605263],"pageRank":0.0011251986440082738}
