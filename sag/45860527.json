{"id":45860527,"name":"Divide-and-Conquer with Sequential Monte Carlo","abstraction":"We introduce a new Bayesian model for hierarchical clustering based on a prior over trees called Kingman\u0027s coalescent. We develop novel greedy and sequential Monte Carlo inferences which operate in a bottom-up agglomerative fashion. We show experimentally the superiority of our algorithms over others, and demonstrate our approach in document clustering and phylolinguistics.
