{"id":283258918,"name":"Generalized Non-Orthogonal Joint Diagonalization With LU Decomposition and Successive Rotations","abstraction":"Blind Components Processing (BCP), a novel approach in processing of data (signal,image, etc.) components, is introduced as well some applications to information communications technology (ICT) are proposed. The newly introduced BCP is with capability of deployment orientation in a wider range of applications. The fundamental of BCP is based on Blind Source Separation (BSS), a methodology which searches for unknown sources of mixtures without a prior knowledge of either the sources or the mixing process. Most of the natural, biomedical as well as industrial observed signals are mixtures of different components while the components and the way they mixed are unknown. If we decompose the signal into its components by BSS, then we can process the components separately without interfering the other components signal/data. Such internal access to signal components leads to extraction of plenty of information as well more efficient processing compared to normal signal processing where in all the structure of the signal is gone under processing and modification. This manuscript besides the introducing blind component processing, proposes some practical application with technical merit.","authors":["Ninoslav Marina","Faramarz Asharif"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2399949_Source_Separation_From_Dusk_Till_Dawn","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222473499_Blind_Separation_of_Sources_Part_I_An_Adaptative_Algorithm_Based_on_Neuromimetic_architecture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245588333_Blind_separation_of_sources_parts_I-III","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3316662_Blind_source_separation_semiparametric_statistical_approach_IEEE_Trans_Signal_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2749907_Stability_Analysis_Of_Adaptive_Blind_Source_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222489418_Independent_Component_Analysis_a_New_Concept","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2611505_A_New_Learning_Algorithm_for_Blind_Signal_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12375179_Oja_E_Independent_Component_Analysis_Algorithms_and_Applications_Neural_Networks_134-5_411-430","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230851749_A_PDF-matched_Short-term_Linear_Predictability_Approach_to_Blind_Source_Separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276911759_Crosstalk_Rejection_in_3-D-Stacked_Interchip_Communication_With_Blind_Source_Separation"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[2399949,222473499,245588333,3316662,2749907,222489418,2611505,12375179,230851749,276911759],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
