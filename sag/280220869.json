{"id":280220869,"name":"Evolving Fuzzy-GARCH Approach for Financial Volatility Modeling and Forecasting","abstraction":"In this paper we perform Bayesian estimation of stochastic volatility models with heavy tail distributions using Metropolis adjusted Langevin (MALA) and Riemman manifold Langevin (MMALA) methods. We provide analytical expressions for the application of these methods, assess the performance of these methodologies in simulated data and illustrate their use on two financial time series data sets.","authors":["Mauricio Zevallos"],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4986809_%27GMM_Estimation_of_a_Stochastic_Volatility_Model_a_Monte_Carlo_Study%27","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257259241_Bayesian_Inference_in_Statistical_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227375782_Riemann_manifold_Langevin_and_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995466_Multivariate_Stochastic_Variance_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265446090_Modeling_Financial_Time_Series","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215446267_Monte_Carlo_Strategies_in_Scientic_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4995513_Stochastic_Volatility_Likelihood_Inference_and_Comparison_with_ARCH_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264947048_Time_Series_Analysis_by_State_Space_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4895838_Conditional_Heteroskedasticity_in_Asset_Returns_A_New_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4764939_Estimation_Methods_for_Stochastic_Volatility_Models_A_Survey"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[4986809,257259241,227375782,4995466,265446090,215446267,4995513,264947048,4895838,4764939],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
