{"id":281670472,"name":"Some reward-penalty rules for the multi-armed bandit problem which are asymptotically optimal","abstraction":"We develop asymptotically optimal policies for the multi armed bandit (MAB), problem, under a cost constraint. This model is applicable in situations where each sample (or activation) from a population (bandit) incurs a known bandit dependent cost. Successive samples from each population are iid random variables with unknown distribution. The objective is to have a feasible policy for deciding from which population to sample from, so as to maximize the expected sum of outcomes of $n$ total samples or equivalently to minimize the regret due to lack on information of sample distributions, For this problem we consider the class of feasible uniformly fast (f-UF) convergent policies, that satisfy sample path wise the cost constraint. We first establish a necessary asymptotic lower bound for the rate of increase of the regret function of f-UF policies. Then we construct a class of f-UF policies and provide conditions under which they are asymptotically optimal within the class of f-UF policies, achieving this asymptotic lower bound. At the end we provide the explicit form of such policies for the case in which the unknown distributions are Normal with unknown means and known variances.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220151284_Exploration-exploitation_tradeoff_using_variance_estimates_in_multi-armed_bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226908641_UCB_revisited_Improved_regret_bounds_for_the_stochastic_multi-armed_bandit_problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236687883_Bandits_with_Knapsacks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224943907_REGAL_A_Regularization_based_Algorithm_for_Reinforcement_Learning_inWeakly_Communicating_MDPs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221665493_The_best_of_both_worlds_Stochastic_and_adversarial_bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276296954_Asymptotic_Behavior_of_Minimal-Exploration_Allocation_Policies_Almost_Sure_Arbitrarily_Slow_Growing_Regret","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273117431_Multi-armed_bandits_under_general_depreciation_and_commitment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275332251_Normal_Bandits_of_Unknown_Means_and_Variances_Asymptotic_Optimality_Finite_Horizon_Regret_Bounds_and_a_Solution_to_an_Open_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257516072_Asymptotically_optimal_Bayesian_sequential_change_detection_and_identification_rules"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[220151284,226908641,220343796,236687883,224943907,221665493,276296954,273117431,275332251,257516072],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
