{"id":270906191,"name":"Tail exponent estimation via broadband log density-quantile regression","abstraction":"We establish a Bernstein-type inequality for a class of stochastic processes that include the classical geometrically $\\phi$-mixing processes, Rio\u0027s generalization of these processes, as well as many time-discrete dynamical systems. Modulo a logarithmic factor and some constants, our Bernstein-type inequality coincides with the classical Bernstein inequality for i.i.d.~data. We further use this new Bernstein-type inequality to derive an oracle inequality for generic regularized empirical risk minimization algorithms and data generated by such processes. Applying this oracle inequality to support vector machines using the Gaussian kernels for both least squares and quantile regression, it turns out that the resulting learning rates match, up to some arbitrarily small extra term in the exponent, the optimal rates for i.i.d.~processes.","authors":[],"citedInUrls":[],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232973393_Bernstein-type_large_deviations_inequalities_for_partial_sums_of_strong_mixing_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1765888_A_tail_inequality_for_suprema_of_unbounded_empirical_processes_with_applications_to_markov_chains_Electron_J_Probab","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2820954_Statistical_Properties_of_Dynamical_Systems_with_Some_Hyperbolicity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38331254_Spectral_theory_zeta_functions_and_the_distribution_of_periodic_points_for_Collet-Eckmann_maps_Comm_Math_Phys","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48205123_Estimating_conditional_quantiles_with_the_help_of_the_pinball_loss","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239019234_Some_Limit_Theorems_for_Stationary_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29611893_Bernstein_inequality_and_moderate_deviations_under_strong_mixing_conditions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267653277_Weak_Dependence_With_Examples_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349018_Optimal_aggregation_of_classifiers_in_statistical_learning_Annals_of_Statististics_321","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497384_Optimal_Rates_for_Regularized_Least_Squares_Regression"],"citedInIDs":[],"refrenceIDs":[232973393,1765888,2820954,38331254,48205123,239019234,29611893,267653277,38349018,221497384],"pageRank":5.314734299140724E-4}
