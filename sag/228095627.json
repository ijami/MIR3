{"id":228095627,"name":"An Empirical Study of Stochastic Variational Algorithms for the Beta Bernoulli Process","abstraction":"We present a hybrid algorithm for Bayesian topic models that combines the efficiency of sparse Gibbs sampling with the scalability of online stochastic inference. We used our algorithm to analyze a corpus of 1.2 million books (33 billion words) with thousands of topics. Our approach reduces the bias of variational inference and generalizes to many Bayesian hidden-variable models.","authors":["Matt Hoffman","David Blei"],"citedInUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279309917_An_Empirical_Study_of_Stochastic_Variational_Algorithms_for_the_Beta_Bernoulli_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268451692_A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach_Toward_Stacked_Convolutional_Independent_Component_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236687792_Stochastic_Collapsed_Variational_Bayesian_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation"],"refrenceUrls":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619032_Asynchronous_Distributed_Learning_of_Topic_Models"],"citedInIDs":[279309917,268451692,236687792],"refrenceIDs":[221619032],"pageRank":7.914591864518918E-4}
